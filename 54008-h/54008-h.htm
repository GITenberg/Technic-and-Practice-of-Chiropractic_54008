<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> little work is offered to the profession without
apology for its brevity or its form. It has been
prepared because of an immediate and pressing need
for such a guide in our colleges, and is offered abroad under
the impression that many practicing Chiropractors feel the
same need.</p>

<p>It is intended for handy reference and clinical use and
is arranged as systematically as possible, style being everywhere
sacrificed to utility.</p>

<p>The author lays no claim to the origination of any of
the subject matter of this book nor to having invented any
of the movements described under Technic of Adjusting.
The arrangement and phraseology are in the main original.
The intention has been merely to condense into practical
and convenient form for students and practitioners certain
knowledge now held and utilized in our profession.</p>

<p>The author feels himself indebted to the entire profession
for the information embodied in this work, and to
scientists of all time upon the results of whose infinite and

Constructive criticism and suggestion are invited from all
sources, for by our interchange of thoughts we grow.</p>

<h2 id="h_4"><a id="VERTEBRAL_PALPATION"></a>VERTEBRAL PALPATION</h2>
</div>

<h4 id="h_5">Definition</h4>

<p>Vertebral Palpation consists in the use of the tactile
sense to determine the position, relation, size, shape, and as
far as possible the condition, of the segments of the spinal
column, in order thus to discover the primary causes indicative
of disease.</p>

<p>Or, Vertebral Palpation is the name given the manual
examination of spinal vertebrae.</p>

<h4 id="h_6">General Propositions</h4>

<p>Every palpation should be made with the adjustment of
the vertebrae in mind. The record of palpation should be
a correct guide as to direction of adjustment. No subluxation
impossible of adjustment should be recorded.</p>

<p>The two essentials of correct palpation are <em>accurate perception</em>
and <em>correct reasoning</em>. To secure the first, a certain
approved manner of using the hands is herein laid down
and a considerable amount of tactile sense development by
practice is required. Correct reasoning depends upon
knowledge of all the important facts concerning the spine
and of the rules governing palpation.</p>

<p>Absolute concentration is required and to this end many
of the following rules are directed.</p>

<h4 id="h_7">Habits of Palpation</h4>

<p>Every palpater unconsciously forms habits of thought
and action. These habits may be good or bad. We deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
form a habit of holding the first three fingers closely
together or the habit of using a downward glide, but we
should avoid the habit of finding certain subluxations because
they are usual and expected rather than because they
are actually there. For instance, one may easily form a
habit of listing every other vertebra in the spine, his whole
record thus depending upon his first choice.</p>

<p>Because of this perfectly natural tendency to establish
a routine of thought and action and to follow it precisely,
it is best not to attempt palpation without the aid of an experienced
teacher until after correct habits have been
formed. Once formed, a palpation habit, right or wrong,
is very hard to break. Many a teacher has expended himself
uselessly in the effort to undo some technical fault acquired
by the student in a blundering undirected trial.</p>

<h4 id="h_8">Facts Concerning the Spine</h4>

<p>The spinal column is composed of twenty-six segments
called vertebrae, twenty-four movable and two fixed. The
movable vertebrae are divided for convenience in study into
three sections. There are seven Cervical vertebrae, twelve
Dorsal, and five Lumbar in the normal individual. The
number of Dorsals or Lumbars may vary by one in a rare
case. These variations occur in about one spinal column in
each five hundred and are usually in the Lumbar region,
which may contain four or six vertebrae. A prominent first
sacral spinous process may be mistaken for an extra Lumbar.</p>

<p>Five vertebrae have special names. The first Cervical
is called Atlas; the second Cervical, Axis; the seventh Cervical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
is commonly known as Vertebra Prominens on account
of its long and large spinous process, although this
long process belongs to the sixth Cervical or first Dorsal
instead in 35% of all cases; the large, irregularly fusiform
vertebra just below the Lumbars and between the ilia is
called the Sacrum; and the smaller one below it, the Coccyx.
The latter is occasionally missing.</p>

<p>Each vertebra except the Atlas is composed of a body
and an arch; the arch is made up of two pedicles, short,
thick plates of bone extending outward and backward from
the postero-lateral surface of the body nearer its upper than
its lower border, two laminae, thin plates of bone extending
backward and inward from their union with the pedicles and
joining behind to form the spinous process, and has projecting
from it seven processes, two transverse, one spinous,
and four articular, two of which are superior and two inferior.
The foramen enclosed by the body, pedicles, and
laminae is called the neural or vertebral foramen and the
canal formed by the connection of these foramina and completed
by the ligaments which unite the arches is called
the neural, vertebral, or spinal canal. It contains the spinal
cord with its membranes and the roots of the spinal nerves.
By means of the four articular processes each true vertebra
except the first articulates with its fellows above and below.</p>

<p>The body of the vertebra is its largest portion and is
joined to its fellows by fibrocartilaginous disks which are
sufficiently elastic to permit some torsion and compression.
Nine sets of ligaments, including the intervertebral substance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
just mentioned, bind the vertebrae firmly together.
Many muscles are attached to the spinal column.</p>

<p>The intervertebral foramina are openings at the sides
of the vertebrae, formed by the notching of apposed pedicles.
These openings are surrounded by bone, cartilage, and
ligaments and vary in shape in different sections of the
spine. They permit the exit of the spinal nerves and their
sheaths, the re-entrance of some nerve fibres into the neural
canal, and the passage of blood-vessels to and from the cord.
The entire philosophy of Chiropractic focuses at the intervertebral
foramen because there we find the primary cause
of all pathological changes in the body.</p>

<p>The spinous and transverse processes merit particular
description since they are the levers by which vertebrae are
adjusted and nerve impingements at the intervertebral foramina
corrected. But it will be found easiest to describe
these processes separately in different sections of the spine
and before proceeding to this description, a brief picture
of the peculiar vertebrae will be presented.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Atlas</dfn> is a bony ring composed of two arches, an
anterior and a posterior, separated in the recent state by a
transverse ligament. Its body is detached and appears as
a tooth-like projection upward from the body of the Axis,
the odontoid process, which articulates with the anterior
arch of the Atlas and around which the Atlas rotates, a
ring around a pivot. The Atlas supports the head upon
its lateral masses, two wedge shaped bodies between the
anterior and posterior arches, thinner internally than externally.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
It has no spinous process but merely a tubercle
where the laminae join, so that it can be palpated only from
the sides upon the tips of its long transverses. The first
Cervical, or suboccipital, nerves emerge by a groove above
the pedicles instead of through a foramen.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Axis</dfn>, or second Cervical, is distinguished by its
large, strong spinous process, which is bifid at its tip, by its
superior articular processes which rest upon body, pedicles,
and transverses, and by its odontoid process, upreared from
the body.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Seventh Cervical</dfn>, or Vertebral Prominens, usually
has a large spinous process, presents no foramina in its
transverse processes, or only one, the left, and shows no
facets on body or transverse for the rib articulation, as do
the Dorsals.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Sacrum</dfn> is the largest vertebra; is curved with its
convexity backward; is commonly made up of five fused
segments; has only rudimentary spinous and transverse
processes except the first; and shows sixteen openings, eight
anterior and eight posterior, or four on either side of the
median line in front and the same number and arrangement
behind. These openings permit the exit of the anterior and
posterior primary divisions of the sacral nerves separately.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Coccyx</dfn>, usually composed of four fused segments,
is a triangular bone which articulates with the Sacrum
above and is free at its distal extremity. Its portion of the
neural canal is open posteriorly and contains merely the
thread-like termination of the cord membranes. It is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
ankylosed to the Sacrum, sometimes in an abnormal
position so as to impinge the single pair of coccygeal nerves.</p>

<p>The different regions of the spine show decided differences
in structure, though all resemble each other. The
Cervicals are smallest, the Dorsals next in size, and the
Lumbars largest and strongest of the movable vertebrae.
The Dorsals have facets and demi-facets for the articulation
of the twelve pairs of ribs with their bodies and intervertebral
substance, as well as oval facets upon the anterior
aspect of their transverses for articulation with the tubercles
of the ribs.</p>

<p>The <dfn>spinous processes</dfn> are smallest and usually bifurcated
down to and including the fifth. The sixth may show
a plain bifurcation, or on any Cervical the bifurcation may
be so small as to be imperceptible to touch. The spinous
process of the second overlies that of the third so as to
make the latter very difficult of detection. Indeed, all cervical
spinous processes down to the sixth are harder to
palpate than those in other regions, owing to the anterior
cervical curve. The processes lie in a groove between
prominent muscle ridges.</p>

<p>Dorsal spinous processes are usually single, although the
last four, three, two, or one may show plain bifurcation in
certain individuals. They are somewhat pointed and overlap,
except the lower ones, the obliquity being greatest in
the mid-dorsal region and least at the first and last dorsals.</p>

<p>Lumbar vertebrae have broad, flat-tipped spinous processes
much larger than the others. The last Dorsal may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
sometimes appear like a Lumbar in shape, so that the change
in shape commonly supposed to mark a division between
Dorsals and Lumbars is not always an infallible guide.</p>

<p>The <dfn>transverse</dfn> processes in the cervical region are very
short and lie close in front of the articular processes. They
are pierced by foramina for the vertebral artery and vein,
except the seventh, which may have one foramen or none.
They are difficult of access for palpation because of their
shortness and the amount of overlying muscle, but may be
reached from the front and side by drawing back the
sternomastoid. They increase in length from the second
to the seventh.</p>

<p>In the dorsal region the transverses are larger and
stronger and more constant in size, shape, and direction,
serving to support rib articulations. They extend in a
curved direction outward, backward, and slightly upward
from the union of laminae and pedicles and terminate in a
large subcutaneous club-shaped extremity which may be
readily palpated. The eleventh and twelfth dorsal transverses
do not articulate with the ribs and must therefore
be used with caution or not at all as levers for adjustment.
The dorsal transverses are located on a higher level than
the spinous processes. In the case of the upper three dorsals
the transverse lies in a plane which would cross the
mid-spinal line between its own and the next superior spinous.
In the mid-dorsal region the transverse is even with
the spinous of the vertebra above, though the relation may
vary slightly. The lower dorsals return to the same relation
as the upper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>The transverse processes of the Lumbars are relatively
light compared with the general structure of the vertebrae
and are found just even with the interspace between
their own and the adjacent superior spinous process. They
vary greatly in size, length and strength and may be used
as levers for adjustment only when they are large enough
to be clearly palpable through the muscle mass which separates
them from the body surface.</p>

<h4 id="h_9">Preparation of Patient</h4>

<p>In all cases where a complete spinal examination is intended
the preparation is essentially the same. Have patient
arrange clothing so that the spine is exposed to the touch
throughout. Avoid bands of cloth across the spine, as these
interfere with the necessary continuous gliding movement
of the fingers. Advise the patient, if a female, to wear
waist or dressing sack, reversed, and have skirts loosened
at the waist. If a man, he should strip to the waist and
wear coat or coat shirt reversed.</p>

<h4 id="h_10">Position of Patient</h4>

<p>This varies widely according to circumstances but for
general purposes use position:</p>

<p>(A) Place patient on stool, feet even on floor and body
in an easy, relaxed position. This may be modified by asking
him to lean forward and rest elbows on knees, evenly,
to facilitate Lumbar palpation. Patient’s head may be erect
or flexed forward or backward but should never be rotated
or laterally flexed during Cervical palpation except for the
purpose of locating some particular transverse process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>(B) In emergency cases, where haste is urgent or
patient is unable to assume a sitting posture, or as a means
of re-verifying previous palpation, place the patient on
adjusting table prone, face down. (See <a href="#ip_46">Fig. 2</a>.) Remember
that with the head lying upon its side the upper dorsal
vertebrae will assume a curve with its convexity away from
the face. Palpation in position (B) should precede every
adjustment and, to guard against error, should be considered
as a necessary preliminary to the movement of any
vertebra.</p>

<p>(C) For palpation preparatory to using the Rotary,
the Break, and other moves, have patient lying on his back
with his head projecting beyond upper end of bench and
resting on the hands and wrists of the palpater, or have
the patient’s head rest on the bench, a less accessible
position.</p>

<h4>General Observation</h4>

<p>Each spinal examination should begin with a general
survey by which curvatures, marked prominences, etc., may
be appreciated. Frequently some very important fact may
be noted which would escape attention upon minute examination.</p>

<h3 id="h_11">THE RECORD</h3>

<p>The record of spinal palpation, when completed, should
be an accurate history of the irregularities found in the
spine and an accurate guide to adjustment. It must be
brief and concise as well as readily comprehensible. One
should be able to see at a glance any desired point on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
record, so that it may be used during the adjustment without
undue loss of time or attention. Obviously the introduction
of any useless mark or sign, such as the inclusion
of a number and blank space for each vertebra of the spine,
or all possible subluxations with indications as to which
do or do not exist in the given case, is a mistake.</p>

<p>The record should contain three parallel columns. In
the first column place the number of the vertebra chosen
for adjustment. In the second, place the direction of subluxation.
In the third, place the word or sign which stands
for the indicated movement for correction.</p>

<h4>Number of Vertebra</h4>

<p>The letter C is used to indicate Cervical, D Dorsal, L
Lumbar, and S Sacrum in the record. Immediately following
the letter which designates the region, place the number
which shows the position in that region occupied by the
vertebra in question, the <em>relation</em> of that vertebra to its fellows.
For instance, the third Cervical vertebra is C 3, the
eleventh Dorsal D 11. To the S for Sacrum append B or
A to indicate that the Base or Apex is described as to
position. This <em>locates</em> the subluxation. For a record of full
spine palpation it is unnecessary to use the letters C, D, or L
more than once, as subluxations are recorded in the order
of their occurrence from above downward. A dash should
always follow the number of the vertebra to separate it
from the letters in the second column for convenience in
reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<div class="intact">
<h4 id="dirsub">Direction of Subluxation</h4>

<p>The directions considered in palpating or recording subluxations
are six in number, namely:</p>

<table id="sublux" class="p1" summary="Directions of subluxation">
  <tr class="smaller">
    <td class="tdl">Name</td>
    <td class="tdc">Abbreviation</td>

    <td class="tdc">I</td>
    <td class="tdl">Toward the feet (Caudad)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>As the fingers glide down the spine the <em>posterior</em> vertebra
is the one which interposes itself in the path of the
fingers, forcing them to describe an outward curve. It
is the hill on the automobile road which forces the surmounting
of a curved departure from the evenness of the
road. It is <em>relatively</em> posterior to its fellows above and
below.</p>

<p>The <dfn>anterior</dfn> vertebra, to the gliding fingers, means a
depression, a valley. It causes the fingers to dip inward
from the level of their course.</p>

<p>The <dfn>right</dfn> or the <dfn>left</dfn> subluxation is appreciated by running
the tips of the fingers down the sides of the spinous
processes. It really indicates rotation of the whole vertebra
more often than any other malposition.</p>

<p>We say that a vertebra is <em>superior</em> when its spinous
process is nearer the one above than the one below. It
requires a measuring of relative distances. The degree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
to which a vertebra is superior is measured, not by its actual
closeness to its fellow, but by the relation between the space
above and the space below.</p>

<p>Likewise a vertebra is <em>inferior</em> when it is closer to its
fellow below than to its fellow above.</p>

<p><em>Anterior</em> subluxations are rarely recorded as such, except
of the Cervicals or the last Lumbar, because no means
of properly adjusting them is known to Chiropractic.</p>

<h4>Order of Letters</h4>

<p>In the second column, that devoted to direction of subluxation,
the letter P or A should appear, if at all, as this
antero-posterior relation is the first thing to be determined
concerning any individual subluxation chosen except the
Atlas. With the Atlas the first letter will be R or L. Next
the laterality or rotation is indicated by R or L in every
case except Atlas subluxation. Finally the S or I indicates
the last point to be determined, the <em>approximation</em> of the
vertebra to its fellows. This last letter usually shows thinning
of intervertebral fibrocartilage, which will be discussed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you desire to emphasize any direction as being more
important than another, underscore the letter which stands
for that direction with a single line. If two directions are
to be emphasized, one more than another, underscore the
one with two lines and the other with one. For example,
if a vertebra is found to be quite decidedly posterior, <em>more</em>
plainly to the right, and <em>slightly</em> superior, the record will
show it thus: <em><span class="undersingle">P</span> <span class="underdouble">R</span> S</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement for Correction</h4>

<p>This is indicated in the third column, separated from the
second by a dash, by means of some brief word or words
which describe a certain movement used in adjusting. The
descriptive words and terms used in this work are all given
and explained under Technic of Adjusting. (See <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>.)
Each word or term stands for a definite method of procedure.
The best movement for the correction of any
subluxation of any vertebra may be found by reference
to the section on <a href="#h_36">Preferable Adjustments</a>, <a href="#Page_155">p. 155</a>. If other
terms are more familiar to the student, or in time replace
those which are now common usage in the profession, they
will be brief and clear and may be easily substituted for
those given.</p>

<p>Palpation, fixing in the mind of the palpater the manner
and direction of the subluxation, should also suggest as the
obvious correction a movement calculated to reverse the
procedure by which the subluxation was first produced. In
other words, a certain kind of subluxation stands as the
effect of a certain application of force along definite lines
determinable by examination. Its correction should be made
in a reverse direction along the same lines. By recording
with the record of subluxation the desired correction, the
adjuster may be reminded daily without new palpation of
the movement best fitted to the case. If on trial it is
decided that some other movement than the one first indicated
will better overcome the abnormality, the record
should be changed to correspond to the decision, and thereafter
followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<h4>Complete Record</h4>

<p>The completed record in three columns separated by
dashes can be conveniently read. It contains no superfluous
mark of any kind. It conveys all the necessary information
leading to adjustment except diagnosis and case
history. This palpation record should be a part of a more
comprehensive record concerning the case in full and is
best kept on a card, the reverse side of which carries case
history. If kept in an indexed card file it may be referred
to daily without loss of time and an accurate handling of
each case be assured.</p>

<p>Have card perfectly blank on palpation record side.
For convenience in reading draw a heavy line beneath the
last Cervical subluxation recorded and another beneath the
last Dorsal, thus dividing the record as the spine is divided,
into three divisions.</p>

<p>Below follows a sample palpation record. It will be
seen that here in a very small space may be recorded a
great deal of information, for this record contains an accurate
list of the primary causes of every disease, weakness,
or tendency to disease with which the patient is afflicted,
together with the methods for their removal.</p>

<p>The above record is made with patient sitting. It is to
be used while patient is lying upon the adjusting bench.
The most convenient way is to begin palpation in the Dorsal
region after patient has been placed for adjustment, in this
way. If first subluxation recorded is D 2—P R I, find the
vertebra in the region of D 2 which appears P R I to the
touch. To avoid error, let the fingers then glide downward
to the next recorded subluxation. If this be found to agree
in number and direction with the record, it is safe to assume
that the first one found was correctly numbered in
the palpater’s mind; if not, that an error was made. This
can be quickly done. Before each adjustment the vertebra
adjusted should be found to agree with the record; by
doing this constant accuracy may be assured.</p>

<h3 id="h_12">THE COUNT</h3>

<p>Having described the preparation of the patient and the
different positions in which he may be palpated, noted that
all records should be made in position A, mentioned that
general observation which should immediately precede actual
palpation, and interpolated a description of the record to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
be made during the palpation, with its use afterward, we
are now ready to consider the technic of the palpation
itself. This should begin with a count of the vertebrae and
continue with Atlas palpation, general examination of a
group of vertebrae, and special examination of individual
subluxations in the group. Each of these tasks will be
considered in turn.</p>

<h4>Position of Palpater</h4>

<p>This depends upon the position of the patient. The
letters which follow correspond to the letters describing
the position of the patient. q. v.</p>

<p>(A) If you desire to palpate with the right hand stand
at patient’s left and face toward him with left hand resting
on his shoulder or supporting his forehead as you palpate
Dorsals or Cervicals respectively. To use left hand stand
similarly at patient’s right. Have palpating arm relaxed
and easy, extending as nearly as possible so that the forearm
and hand make a right angle with the patient’s spine.
Let the arm and hand remain close to the patient’s body
at all times. Keep the elbow close to your own body
and avoid flexion of wrist on forearm, or of forearm on
arm at more than a right angle, since such flexion would
bring about too great muscular tension for close appreciation
of tactile impressions. If necessary lean sidewise and
elevate shoulder and palpating arm in order to preserve
the proper relation between hand and arm when hand must
be elevated as in palpating upper Cervicals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>(B) As above, if you desire to use right hand stand
on left side of patient and if left hand stand on right. If
the patient lies on a bench so constructed that the head
lies on one side, his face must be toward the palpater in
order that the same hand may be used in Cervical as in
other regions. It is inadvisable to change hands except
when absolutely unavoidable. If the patient’s head must
be turned from you palpate the Cervicals by standing with
feet pointed away from patient and turn your body with
one hand resting on patient’s head to hold it steady and
the other palpating as if you were standing on the other
side. This is difficult and it is rarely necessary to count
Cervicals in position B if the record be used as advised
on page 29.</p>

<p>(C) Palpation preparatory to the Cervical adjustment
will be made in this position or in position A, according
as you intend adjusting the Cervicals in the prone or the
sitting posture. For the prone position have the patient’s
head supported by either hand, while the other hand is
applied with the tips of the first three fingers resting on
the tips of the spinous processes, from which position they
may glide smoothly down, noting deviations from normal
in position as well as mentally numbering the vertebrae.
While this method of palpation is not so accurate as those
given elsewhere, and should be used only as an additional
means after record has been made, it will always be necessary
to make a count before adjusting any Cervical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<h4>Use of Hands</h4>

<p>In general it may be stated that the first three fingers
of one hand are used with an easy downward gliding movement
in which only the <em>tips</em> of the three fingers, evenly
placed, are in contact with the patient’s body. This concentrates
the attention upon a very small tactile surface
which may become extremely sensitive by the concentration.
Indeed, it may be said that vertebral palpation only
became an art through the application of the principle of
concentration in practice. The gliding movement is always
<em>downward</em>, because to palpate upward will mass the superficial
tissues under the fingers and confuse the palpater.
If there is uncertainty in the mind of the palpater, as he
proceeds, as to the identity of any vertebra he should go
back to the second Cervical, or to any certainly recognizable
vertebra previously fixed in mind, and recount.</p>

<p>The use of the hands for Atlas palpation differs from
their use elsewhere and will be described under separate
head. The use of the hands with the patient lying face
upward is also different. If the patient be lying prone,
the same three fingers are used and the same downward
glide as with patient sitting.</p>

<div id="ip_32" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="395" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 1. Position of hands in palpation for record.</div></div>

<p>With patient sitting, the palpater should step from side
to side, changing hands frequently and usually palpating
each vertebra with each hand before reaching a conclusion.
There are three reasons for this. More accurate records
may be made by combining two different impressions on
each vertebra; with frequent change of hands one may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
prevent tiring and consequent loss of sensibility of fingers;
this practice develops the tactile organs of both hands
equally so that if occasion demand the use of either hand
alone it is fitted for the task. To be ambidexterous in all
departments of Chiropractic is an invaluable attainment,
too often neglected.</p>

<h4>The Count</h4>

<p>Commence at the second Cervical, the first spinous
process below the occiput, and let the fingers glide smoothly
downward over the tips or along the sides of the spinous
processes, <em>without interruption of motion</em>, until they reach
the Sacrum. The palpater notes each vertebra passed and
its number—mentally—so that when he reaches the Sacrum
he knows that he has passed every intervening vertebra and
received a touch impression from each. The Sacrum itself
may usually be recognized by its peculiar shape and also by
its articulations with the ilia.</p>

<p>If the fingers are raised from their contact during the
count, the palpater must recommence at the second Cervical.
It is impossible to be accurate in replacing the hand, once
removed, until the count has been established and the
peculiarities of certain vertebrae remembered, together with
their numbers.</p>

<p>To determine the location of the fourth Lumbar where,
on account of obesity, lipoma, Cervical lordosis, etc., the
count of Cervicals or Sacral palpation is difficult, drop on
heels behind the patient and place the second finger of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
each hand on the crest of the ileum. Then let the thumbs
meet in the mid-spinal line in the same horizontal plane
as the two second fingers, which spot should correspond
to the interspace between third and fourth Lumbars. This
measurement is accurate in about 98% of all cases, when
patient sits erect; when it varies it will vary by about half
the width of a Lumbar spinous process.</p>

<p>The count should be repeated until the palpater is certain
that he is able to palpate every spinous process distinctly
or to locate accurately any impalpable one. In making
the count, palpater may note the number of some very
prominent and easily recognizable Dorsal or Lumbar vertebra
to be referred to as a starting point for a recount if
confusion arises later. This recounting from some prominent
vertebra is permissible only after the first accurate
count has been made, but then will save the full count,
especially when the patient is in an unfavorable position,
as lying on table during adjustment.</p>

<h4>Difficulties in Counting</h4>

<p>The commonest difficulties met with in counting are
the following:</p>

<p>Inaccessibility of third Cervical, which lies closely beneath
the spinous process of the second and, unless unusually
large or somewhat out of its proper position, cannot
be readily felt.</p>

<p>An occasional anterior fourth or fifth Cervical which
may escape notice unless the head is flexed far toward or
the transverse processes examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>Lipoma or other adipose tissue covering part of the
spine.</p>

<p>A missing epiphyseal plate resulting from fracture and
absorption, which absence may simulate a wide interspace
and be overlooked without careful and detailed observation.</p>

<p>Cervical or Lumbar lordosis. This difficulty may be at
least partially overcome by having head bent far forward
or body leaning forward with elbows resting on knees and
a deliberate attempt on the patient’s part to render the
dorsolumbar spine convex backward.</p>

<p>An anterior fifth Lumbar.</p>

<p>The occasional extra vertebra which confuses the
palpater.</p>

<p>Finally, the greatest of all difficulties is the imperfect
touch of the untrained palpater or the imperfect concentration
of the trained. And this is always remediable.</p>

<h3 id="h_13">ATLAS PALPATION</h3>

<p>With patient in position A stand <em>behind</em> him and place
the tips of the second fingers on the tips of the transverse
processes of the Atlas, or first Cervical. It can be felt on
each side just anterior and inferior to the mastoid process
of the temporal bone. Let the first and third fingers rest
respectively above and below the transverses and determine
whether the Atlas is subluxated as a whole to the Right
or to the Left.</p>

<p>Another convenient method is:</p>

<p>Place first fingers on mastoid processes, second on Atlas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
transverses, and third on angle of jaw. The three fingers
of each hand then constitute the points of a triangle. Imagine
the base line between the first and third fingers and
measure the altitude as a line at right angles to this base
line and reaching to the tip of the second finger as the apex
of the triangle. The relation of the two altitudes determines
the laterality of the Atlas. Thus, if the altitude of
the right triangle is less than that of the left, the Atlas is
laterally displaced to the Right.</p>

<p>The second matter to determine is the <em>rotation</em> of the
Atlas. This is done by using the first and third fingers as
probes to determine the amount of space between the transverse
and the mandible in front or the mastoid behind. The
intention is to compare the laterally prominent side with
the other so that the letter A or P on the record will indicate
the position of the prominent transverse compared with its
fellow.</p>

<p>Next decide as to <em>tipping</em>. Still comparing the prominent
transverse with the other, decide whether it is above
or below the level of the other by the following method.
Placing first three fingers one above the other with the
second finger on the tip of the process, note which transverse
is highest in the space beneath the ear. List the
prominent side as S or Superior, I or Inferior.</p>

<p>Atlas palpation is rendered especially difficult by the
special technic and by the interposing tendons of the sterno-cleido-mastoid
muscle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<h4>Position of Head</h4>

<p>There are three head positions for Atlas palpation. Head
erect, face forward; head flexed forward on chest; head
flexed backward. Sometimes it is necessary to test in all
three positions in order to reach a decision, but ordinarily
the first is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="h_14">THE GROUP METHOD</h3>

<p>In general palpation of the spine the author has had
the greatest success and attained the greatest accuracy
through which is called the Group Method. This consists in
dividing the spine mentally into five groups or sections,
each of which overlaps its fellows except the end groups.
This is of advantage for several reasons.</p>

<p>It limits somewhat the attention of the palpater so that
he may examine thoroughly and in detail the various vertebrae
without holding his attention so closely to one that
he fails to perceive its relation to its surroundings. It furnishes
five or six vertebrae at a time for comparison so
that one may determine which is <em>most</em> subluxated, and
therefore most in need of adjustment, and then allows one
to reason upon the remainder of the group with this major
subluxation in mind.</p>

<p>The use of the Group Method may best be understood
by the study of certain didactic instructions, which follow:</p>

<p>Never record or adjust two subluxations of contiguous
vertebrae except in those unusual cases where they are
equally subluxated and in the same direction; even then it
is wisest to adjust them on alternate days. Let it be understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
that only in <em>exceptional</em> circumstances should two
adjacent vertebrae be listed. The Group Method is chiefly
valuable because of this rule, to prevent the overlooking
of the most important subluxation by selecting that one
<em>first</em>.</p>

<p>Consider the spine as divisible into five groups; in the
first group belong the Cervicals below the Atlas; in the
second, the seventh Cervical and first five Dorsals; in the
third, the vertebrae from the fourth to the eighth Dorsals
inclusive; in the fourth, the last five Dorsals and sometimes
first Lumbar; and in the last group, all of the Lumbars
and the base of the Sacrum. Consider the first Sacral
spinous process here rather than the whole Sacrum and
remember that this process should seem to complete the
regular Lumbar curve. This grouping may be modified
somewhat by the exigencies of palpation in any given case,
but the group considered should always include from four
to seven vertebrae.</p>

<p>In each group proceed in the same manner to select
subluxations. Let the fingers glide over the group, first
on the tips and then along the sides of the spinous processes,
and note that some one vertebra stands out as the
sharpest, most abrupt deviation in the group, thus indicating
its selection. Remember that neither the one above this
nor the one directly below may be adjusted. This narrows
your field of observation for this group to two, three, or
four remaining vertebrae.</p>

<p>Select then such others in the group as need to be listed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
yet do not conflict with the rule against adjacent subluxations.
Proceed to discover and record the exact direction
of each. When this is done examine the next lower group
in the same way and continue until the whole spine has
been palpated.</p>

<p>The Atlas must be considered alone and not as a part
of any of the above mentioned groups and its position is
judged rather by its relation to the head than to other
vertebrae; the Sacrum also requires individual attention,
being compared with the Lumbar curve and with the ilia.</p>

<p>The one most pronounced subluxation in a group is
often mentioned as the “key” to the group, since its correction
would effectually loosen the entire group and sometimes
partially correct the apparent abnormalities of the
rest. It has also been called “major subluxation” to distinguish
it from “minor subluxations” which are the others
of less importance in the group. This term is not a good
one because it suggests what is not always true, namely,
that the mechanically greatest subluxation is more potent
than any other. Occasionally a slighter subluxation irritates
nerves so as to produce a disease more serious and
immediately alarming than the condition following the
greater displacement.</p>

<h4>Example of Group Method</h4>

<p>If, in the Cervicals, it is noticed upon gliding downward
over the spinous processes that the fifth is badly subluxated
and must be adjusted, this fact is held in mind for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
while the palpater remembers that he cannot adjust and
must not list the sixth or fourth. This leaves only the
second, third and seventh for consideration, the Atlas having
been separately examined. The seventh may best be
included in the next group when such a selection is made,
so that the palpater need only decide between the second
and third Cervical, providing Atlas has not been chosen, as
to which, if either, most requires attention. If Atlas has
been listed, then there remains instead only the question as
to whether the third is or is not subluxated.</p>

<p>In using the Group Method no preference is given to
subluxation in any particular direction, save only that below
the Cervicals we discriminate against the anteriors, because
we cannot adjust them. The Group Method has to do with
determining the points of greatest pressure on nerves and
this depends upon one’s impression as to the interrelations
between all the members of the group. (See <a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a> under
<a href="#h_32">Subluxations.)</a></p>

<h3 id="h_15">THE INDIVIDUAL SUBLUXATION</h3>

<p>Having prepared our patient, surveyed the entire spine,
carefully counted the vertebrae to secure a proper orientation,
and specially examined the Atlas, then divided the
spine into groups and selected the vertebrae to be adjusted
with regard to their degree of malposition, let us confine
our attention definitely for the first time to the <em>single</em> vertebra
below the Atlas.</p>

<p>Reread “<a href="#dirsub">Direction of Subluxation</a>” under “<a href="#h_11">The Record</a>,”
<a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>. Also read article on “<a href="#h_29">Subluxations</a>,” <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>Bear in mind that each subluxation recorded is intended
for adjustment and indicate nothing impossible on your
record. For instance, an anterior subluxation in the Dorsal
region cannot be corrected and should not be recorded for
correction.</p>

<p>Remember the six capital letters used in describing a
subluxation.</p>

<p>Use only the <em>downward gliding movement</em> of the three
palpating fingers.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the count as you have established it for
that particular spine, recalling one or two very prominent
and noticeable vertebrae whose numbers you have noted.</p>

<p>Use a light touch. If necessary, change the patient’s
position to make the vertebra more accessible instead of
pressing with more force.</p>

<p>When in doubt as to direction, change sides and use
the other hand. If still in doubt, take a longer glide, covering
six vertebrae instead of three or four.</p>

<p>Keep your mind on your work, forgetful of everything
else.</p>

<p>And picture to yourself the entire vertebra and its surroundings;
its body, pedicles, and laminae, its transverse
processes and all articulations; above all, <em>mentally visualize
the foramina and nerves</em>. Estimate from the position of
each vertebra the pressure at each foramen. Decide whether
the vertebra is rotated, tipped, laterally displaced, anterior
or posterior, or whether the subluxation partakes of several
of these directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Decide in what direction movement of the vertebra would
release most pressure and list accordingly.</p>

<p>Never hesitate to change your opinion if you discover
evidence that you have made a mistake. Keep at all times
an open mind in palpation.</p>

<h4>Cervical Palpation</h4>

<p>The third Cervical, lying under the projecting spinous
process of the larger second, may be hard to find, and therefore
the full count is always required before listing any
vertebra. By requiring the patient, who is in position A,
to drop his head forward and rest its weight in the hand
which is not palpating, the Cervicals may be more easily
palpated. Remember that this posture widens the interspaces
and also makes the spinous processes appear more
posterior than they really are, this difference being most
noticeable at the fourth.</p>

<p>One bifurcation of a Cervical spinous process may be
longer than the other and prove confusing unless care be
taken always to palpate both bifurcations and note their
form. This can almost always be successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>Sometimes the posterior neck muscles and ligaments
will be rigid so that they interfere with palpation and at
the same time make it impossible for the patient to flex his
head forward. Having found that this is due to real <em>contracture</em>
and is therefore not susceptible of voluntary relaxation
by the patient, support the head in front and push
aside the muscles with the fingers, gliding <em>underneath</em> the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
muscle layers as much as possible and close to the spinous
processes.</p>

<p>Transverse palpation in the Cervicals is used to verify
findings from the spinous processes or to differentiate between
rotated and laterally displaced vertebrae and bent
spinous processes when the spinous swerves to right or left.</p>

<h4>Dorsal Palpation</h4>

<p>The Dorsals are usually considered in three groups. It
must be remembered that the form and obliquity of spinous
processes vary considerably in this region. The upper
processes are very slightly oblique, slanting downward, the
middle Dorsals very oblique, and the inferior ones again
only slightly so. There is a form change, most commonly
at the eighth Dorsal, which may be mistaken for a posterior
subluxation. The process here becomes more horizontal
and more blunt.</p>

<p>Among the first four Dorsals a bad lateral or rotated
vertebra may be listed as well as a posterior one, since we
can readily adjust it. In the middle group either the posterior
or rotated vertebra is chosen according to the estimate
as to which causes greatest nerve impingement, either
being adjustable. In the lower group, however, preference
is usually given the posterior vertebra when possible, because
rotary subluxations indicate transverse adjustments
and it is somewhat dangerous in this region to use the
transverses as levers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<h4>Lumbar Palpation</h4>

<p>The Lumbars and Sacrum are considered in one group.
The Lumbars, with patient erect, <em>should</em> curve anteriorly
and the first Sacral spinous process should complete the
regular curve. This is rarely found, however; the normal
is the exception in any part of the spine.</p>

<p>In the Lumbars we usually choose the rotated rather
than the posterior vertebra, but solely because rotation here
produces the greatest degree of impingement. The laterality
of spinous processes, indicating rotation of the whole
vertebra around an axis lying in the transverse line between
the articular processes, can best be perceived, as a
rule, with patient sitting quite erect. If in doubt, have
patient lean forward and rest elbows on knees, which posture
separates the Lumbars, rendering the individual spinous
process easier to discover but the <em>relative</em> position more
difficult of determination.</p>

<p>The fifth Lumbar, if anterior, may be so listed, forming
an exception to the general rule.</p>

<h4>Sacral Palpation—Pelvis</h4>

<p>First palpate Sacrum as if part of Lumbar region. Note
whether the base (upper portion) is posterior or not. Then
stand behind the patient and use both hands to examine
the sacroiliac articulations. Use palmar surfaces with the
flat hand toward patient’s body, and carefully compare the
two sides to detect inequalities, which indicate iliac subluxation,
or rotation of Sacrum between the ilia on a transversely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
disposed axis passing through the two articulations,
in which case the Sacrum is to be adjusted. Do not mistake
a dislocated hip with compensatory tilting of the whole
pelvis, or faulty sitting posture with only one tuber ischii
supporting the body, for pelvic subluxation.</p>

<p>Be not in undue haste to record pelvic subluxations lest
your haste bring its immediate reward in the difficulty of
adjustment.</p>

<h4>The Coccyx</h4>

<p>The Coccyx may be detached from the Sacrum by
various accidents and later re-ankylosed thereto in an abnormal
position so as to impinge upon the rectum or other
structures. Impingement of the coccygeal nerves is usually
unimportant. Chronic and intractable rectal constipation,
with its attendant train of evils, <em>may</em> result from coccygeal
displacement with ankylosis. In spite of numerous treatises
to the contrary, the writer avers that other symptoms
are extremely rare.</p>

<p>To examine the Coccyx use a rubber covering on the
second finger. Place patient face down and insert second
finger per rectum with the palmar surface upward. If
subluxated Coccyx be found, it must usually be fractured
with a sharp jerk, in order to relieve the condition. After
fracture, it may be absorbed or may re-ankylose to the
Sacrum in a better position, or it may remain freely
movable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h_16">PALPATION IN POSITION B</h3>

<p>This is the position for the majority of adjustments,
and as the palpation of each vertebra to be adjusted is a
necessary preliminary to the adjustment, this method,
though not so accurate as the one already described, must
also be used.</p>

<p>The use of the first three fingers of each hand and the
relation of hands to patient’s body is the same as in Position
A, except for palpating Cervicals when the patient’s
face is turned away. It will be found very difficult to make
a correct full count, especially to count Cervicals, in this
position, and is better to use a record already prepared.</p>

<h4>Dorsals</h4>

<p>Begin at, or near, the first Dorsal to palpate in this position.
Find the vertebra which agrees in direction with the
first Dorsal subluxation recorded; let the fingers glide downward
until they reach the vertebra which, according to the
first decision, would correspond in number with the <em>next</em>
subluxation on the record. If this also agrees in direction
with the record it may safely be assumed that you are accurate
in your numbering. Thereafter, during that adjustment,
the count can be made or repeated from any prominent
vertebra the number and identity of which are easily
recognized.</p>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 2. Palpation in Position B, preparatory to adjustment.</div></div>

<h4>Lumbars</h4>

<p>It may be difficult to count or otherwise to palpate the
Lumbars in this position because of the increase in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
normal anterior curve when patient is suspended between
the two sections of the bench. This will be obviated if a
roll be placed under the thighs or if the bench has an adjustable
rear section.</p>

<h4>Cervicals</h4>

<p>If a solid front bench is used remember the spiral turn
in the Cervicals, which occurs because of the resting of the
head on one side. The curve due to this rotation of the
head is compounded with the ever present anterior curve to
make a spiral. Do not expect the vertebrae in this position
to agree in apparent direction with a record made with the
head straight. It is better to make all decisions as to direction
of Cervicals in position A and merely to <em>count</em> them
in other positions.</p>

<p>In position B, if the patient’s face be away from the
palpater it will be necessary to stand with back toward
patient and body twisted, and to change hands for counting,
resting the free hand on patient’s head to insure its
steadiness.</p>

<h4>Disagreements</h4>

<p>If there be any apparent disagreement between findings
in positions B and A, re-examine carefully in both positions,
whereupon that which seemed a disagreement will
probably prove to have been an error in one or the other
palpation. If apparent disagreement persists after searching
examination, position A furnishes the safest guide to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
adjustment because the patient is in his most usual attitude
as regards the spinal curves, muscle tension, etc. But it
is usually wisest when in grave doubt not to adjust the
doubtful vertebra at all.</p>

<h3 id="h_17">PALPATION IN POSITION C</h3>

<p>Since palpation in this position, patient lying on his
back with head supported by palpater’s hands, cannot be so
reliable as that done in position A, the chief point to be
observed is an accurate count. Only the Cervicals below
the first can be properly palpated in this position.</p>

<p>Induce the patient to relax the neck muscles as much
as may be, and use in palpation the first three fingers of
one hand if the count alone is desired or the first three
fingers of <em>both</em> hands if you desire to ascertain the <em>direction</em>
of any vertebra. In the former case let the fingers press
aside the muscles and glide <em>downward</em> from the second Cervical,
being careful to lift the head high enough so that
the third Cervical is not overlooked beneath the overlapping
second. In the latter case let the fingers of both hands
glide gently downward while the patient’s head rests upon
the palpater’s wrists or knee. Palpate the transverses in
much the same manner, paying special attention to their
<em>laterality</em>, felt as a prominence on one side lateral to a
transverse process and a corresponding depression on the
opposite side. Do not be deceived by exceptionally long
transverses where both project outward to an equal degree.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 3. Locative palpation of Cervical spinous processes in Position
C, preparatory to Rotary or Break.</div></div>

<p>Since the greater mass of the vertebra is divided with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
fair equality by the intertransverse line, laterality of transverses
indicates laterality of the whole vertebra with the
possible exception of the anterior portion of the body.
Laterality of a Cervical <em>spinous</em> process may indicate laterality
of the entire vertebra or merely rotation around its
vertical axis, in which the one articular process is separated
from its fellow of the adjacent vertebra while the other
remains in partial apposition.</p>

<h4>Disagreements</h4>

<p>If disagreements appear between palpation made in positions
A and C, re-palpate in both positions. If still uncertain
call a consultation or follow finding in position A. The
Rotary adjustment may sometimes aid in deciding difficult
questions if gently attempted and free movement secured.
With this adjustment a vertebra will not usually move without
rather extreme force unless the articular process on
the side sought to be moved has lost its apposition with its
fellow of the adjacent vertebra. In any case of disagreement
nerve-tracing, the discovery of sensitive nerves on
one side only may aid in decision. A knowledge of probabilities,
previous experience, and the diagnosis may also
serve as partial guides.</p>

<h3 id="h_18">TRANSVERSE PALPATION</h3>

<p>Palpation of the transverse processes is easiest in the
Cervical and mid-dorsal regions and most difficult in upper
Dorsal and Lumbar regions. It has two uses: first, to assist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
in making a record by verifying the work done on the
spinous processes; second, to locate a given transverse
process in order to use it as a lever for the adjustment of
the vertebra.</p>

<p>It will be seen that fulfillment of the first purpose requires
careful examination of the <em>direction</em> and <em>position</em> of
the transverses as compared with each other and with the
spinous process of the same vertebra, while the second requires
only the discovery of the exact <em>location</em> of some
particular transverse. It will be best to consider the three
divisions of the spine separately, excluding from the present
chapter Atlas palpation, which has been thoroughly
described.</p>

<h4>Cervicals</h4>

<p>These can be best palpated in the position for Atlas
palpation; that is, standing behind the patient and using
the palmar surfaces of the fingers of both hands. From
the Atlas transverses follow the anterior border of the
sternomastoid muscle downward, and opposite each spinous
process draw the muscles backward and inward until the
tips of the transverses are found with the middle fingers.
Their position on the two sides may then be easily compared
as well as their relation to those above and below
them.</p>

<div id="ip_50" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="398" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 4. Locative palpation of Dorsal transverse processes.</div></div>

<p>The transverses of the second Cervical may sometimes
be so prominent laterally that they are, or one of them is,
mistaken for an Atlas transverse. As a rule, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
width of the Cervicals increases from the second downward,
the second being narrowest. Chassaignac’s tubercle, on the
transverse process of the sixth Cervical and opposite the
lower border of the cricoid cartilage, is a prominent point
easily felt as a rule. The transverses of the fourth are
usually opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage.</p>

<p>The Cervical transverses lie very close to the articular
processes and the determination of their relation is a better
guide to the condition of the articulation than is spinous
process palpation. It is also more difficult.</p>

<p>Palpation of Cervical transverses to determine laterality
of the vertebra as a whole or its rotation is possible in
position C and has been described under that head.</p>

<h4>Dorsals</h4>

<p>Palpation for <em>direction</em> can be done best in position B.
Use three fingers with a gliding movement along the line
of the transverses, passing over several to determine which
is most posterior. Then repeat the glide on the other side
of the spine to determine whether the transverse corresponding
to the anterior one is posterior or vice versa, showing
that the entire vertebra is merely rotated or is displaced
backward. Some palpaters prefer using both hands and
palpating both transverses at once and there is no serious
objection to this method, if confined to palpation in position
B. In many cases, however, it leads to similar palpation of
spinous processes, a most execrable habit.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that with the first two Dorsals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the transverse will be found in a transverse plane which
would pass between its own spinous process and that above.
This is also true of the last three Dorsals, while in the
middle Dorsals the transverse is usually (not always) level
with the tip of the spinous process of the next superior
vertebra.</p>

<p>Before adjusting, to determine the <em>location</em> of a transverse
process in order to direct an adjustment against it,
first palpate spinous process and hold it with the tip of the
middle finger. Then approximate with the first finger a
point even with the tip of the spinous process above and
about one inch from the spine—this of course in mid-dorsal.
Then let second and third fingers follow the first so that
all three rest on or near the transverse to be palpated.
Pressing gently, but firmly, move the three fingers until the
process can be felt beneath them. Hold the process with
the middle finger so as to direct with it the contact of
the adjusting hand to a point exactly over the transverse
process.</p>

<h4>Lumbars</h4>

<p>The transverses of a Lumbar vertebra lie just even with
the interspace between their own and the adjacent superior
spinous process. They are deeply embedded in muscle
tissue and very hard to palpate. They may vary considerably
in size or length and the last one or two may be absolutely
impalpable. It is sometimes advisable to adjust a
rotated Lumbar by using the transverse as a lever, but this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
should never be attempted unless the process can be distinctly
felt. The method of locating in Lumbar is practically
the same as in the Dorsal region.</p>

<h4>Transverse Palpation with Patient Sitting</h4>

<p>Palpation of Cervical transverses in position A has been
described and is frequently done. Palpation of Dorsal or
Lumbar transverses in the same position may sometimes
be desirable. It can be done with the same movement as
spinous process palpation, and may serve to detect a bent
spinous process.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to palpate both transverses at the same
time, stand in front of the patient and lean over his shoulder,
letting his shoulders rest against your body. Use
palmar surface of fingers of both hands and note which
transverse is posterior to its fellow, if either, or whether
both are posterior to the line of the others above and
below them.</p>

<p>It is rarely possible to find if a transverse process be
superior or inferior to its normal position, except the Atlas
transverses, although this may occasionally be detected.
Fortunately this is a rare form of subluxation, or appears
rare, although it must be said that this apparent rarity may
be due to our comparative inability to detect it in the living
subject.</p>

<h3 id="h_19">CURVES AND CURVATURES</h3>

<p>For convenience, <dfn>curve</dfn> is used to denote the normal
curvilinear deviation from a straight line naturally present
in the normal spine or naturally assumed in response to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the need for equilibrium during the erect position of the
body: <dfn>Curvature</dfn> means either the abnormal increase of
any normal curve or the appearance of any abnormal curvilinear
deviation of vertebrae from their normal position.
Deviations from normal must contain at least three vertebrae
to be considered curvatures.</p>

<h4>Visual Examination</h4>

<p>The general inspection of the spine which precedes the
count should bring to light, in addition to prominent subluxations,
and general symptoms observable by inspection
of the back, any <em>marked curvatures</em>. Their general locality
and direction will be noted by this observation and their
details left to be discovered by closer examination.</p>

<p>During palpation with a long and rapid glide one may
also note these general points with respect to any curvature.</p>

<p>Do not mistake the four normal curves, the anterior
Cervical and Lumbar and the posterior Dorsal and Sacral,
for curvatures. The normal Lumbar curve is so unusual
in practice that a novice has been known to name it a
lordosis.</p>

<h4 id="curvatures">Description of Curvatures</h4>

<p>Four varieties of curvature are commonly described.
<dfn>Kyphosis</dfn> is a curvature with its convexity directed backward,
usually, but not always, found in the Dorsal region.
<dfn>Lordosis</dfn>, the opposite of Kyphosis, is an anterior curvature,
usually in the Lumbar in which case it is an accentuation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of the normal curve. <dfn>Scoliosis</dfn> has its convexity directed
laterally either to the right or the left. It is commonly
also <dfn>Rotatory</dfn>, having its vertebrae rotated around
their vertical axes so as to make the outer or the inner
transverses more prominent than those on the other side.</p>

<p>In a Scoliosis the rotation may swing either the bodies
or the spinous processes toward the convex side of the
curvature; the latter is much the easier of adjustment while
the former furnishes one of the most intricate problems of
adjustment.</p>

<h4>Cause of Curvatures</h4>

<p>Without entering here into a discussion of those disturbed
metabolic processes—themselves the result of subluxation—which
result in curvature by general softening of
the bone, as in rachitis or spondylitis deformans, we will
simply state the general proposition that almost all curvatures
which are in any degree <em>angular</em> result from a single
subluxation to be found at the point of the angle. It has
been demonstrated in such cases that adjustment at that
point will correct the curvature in time but it is usually
wiser to hasten matters by selecting other points of attack
by a method to be presently suggested.</p>

<p>Long, regular, but not pronounced, Scoliosis, usually in
the Dorsal, may be an example of <em>occupation curvature</em>,
following the continued use of muscles in a fixed position
and not due to subluxation. Another example is the mailman’s
Lordosis. These in themselves are not detrimental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
to health and are negligible unless some special point of
impingement through individual subluxation exists within
them.</p>

<p>The sharp, angular kyphosis of Pott’s Disease, tubercular
caries of the vertebrae, the curvature involving three or
four vertebrae which are extremely tender to palpation,
should warn against adjustment unless one can be very
certain that the vertebrae are sufficiently intact. Fracture
of a decayed vertebra is easily possible under adjustment.
The cause of Pott’s Disease is usually at the angle point,
most frequently the tenth Dorsal but possibly any Dorsal
from fifth to twelfth.</p>

<h4>Record on Curvatures</h4>

<p>If it is the purpose of the examiner to straighten the
curvature he should choose for adjustment a series of non-adjacent
vertebrae which are most prominent in the direction
of the curvature; thus in a right scoliosis he should
choose only those vertebrae most prominently out to the
<em>right</em>, and in a kyphosis only posterior ones. A lordosis
as such cannot be properly adjusted except in the Cervicals,
but lordosis is usually a compensating curvature (see below)
and can be otherwise corrected.</p>

<p>If the patient suffers from some disease which assumes
more importance than the curvature and demands attention,
select the one vertebra which is causing the disease, without
reference to its position in the curvature, and adjust that
vertebra into a proper relation with the adjacent ones, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
though you adjust directly toward the convexity of the
curvature. Disease may often be relieved by <em>making a
curvature regular</em> more quickly than by eliminating the
entire curvature. Sometimes both considerations may influence
the selection of vertebrae.</p>

<p>In a curvature there is not necessarily pressure on nerves
at every foramen. In fact, such pressure is the exception
rather than the rule in curvature and a careful study of
the spine must be made in order that adjustments may be
accomplished without <em>causing</em> temporary impingement here
and there.</p>

<p>A foot-note describing curvature may be appended to
the record of palpation. It should contain the special name
of the curvature, whether simple or compound, and the
numbers of the first and last vertebrae in it. For instance,
note may read: “Right rotary scoliosis from D 3 to L 1
inclusive.”</p>

<h4>Compensatory Curvatures</h4>

<p>When a primary curvature is present one or two secondary
curvatures usually appear to preserve the equilibrium of
the body. With a Dorsal kyphosis there is often a Lumbar
lordosis and sometimes less marked lordosis in both Cervical
and Lumbar. With a primary right scoliosis in the
Lumbar there will be a secondary left scoliosis above. The
secondary curvature is called compensatory. In selecting
vertebrae for adjustment it is well to neglect the compensatory
curvature as much as possible, leaving it to right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
itself as the primary one is corrected. If, however, the
primary curvature be a lordosis, and not adjustable, work
on the secondary curvature may gradually aid in reducing
the primary, to a certain extent at least.</p>

<h4>Ankylosis</h4>

<p>This topic is discussed here partly because it is so often
associated with curvature.</p>

<p>Ankylosis can be appreciated only by detecting the lack
of normal movement between adjacent vertebrae. Place a
finger in the interspace between suspected vertebrae and ask
the patient to perform the movement calculated to separate
the spinous processes in a normally movable spine. If in
the Dorsals, ask him to drop the head and shoulders as
far forward as possible without bending at the hips. Alternate
repetitions of this movement with straightening and the
spinous processes should alternately separate and approach
each other. Test several successive vertebrae so as to note
that all change their position except two.</p>

<p>In the Lumbars have the patient repeatedly bend the
body forward from the hips striving to make his spine
convex backward. In the Cervicals forward flexion of the
head will serve. Occasionally general ankylosis is found
with curvature, as in Spondylitis Deformans.</p>

<p>Many Chiropractors mistake failure to move a vertebra
with an attempted adjustment for evidence of ankylosis.
In nine cases out of ten such failure is due to other reasons,
ankylosis being very infrequent. It is a much abused excuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
for incapability. Free movement between spinous processes
is <em>absolute proof</em> that the vertebrae are not ankylosed.</p>

<h3 id="h_20">DIFFICULTIES IN PALPATION</h3>

<p>The chief difficulty arises from failure to observe some
of the rules herein laid down.</p>

<p>Carelessness or inattention precludes accuracy.</p>

<p>Pain may cause the patient to assume an unnatural or
cramped attitude simulating curvature, especially of the
Cervicals. More errors occur from this cause in judging
the laterality of C 2 than with any other vertebra.</p>

<p>The occasional bent spinous process in Cervical or
Dorsal regions may deceive the palpater unless transverse
palpation is employed. But the frequency of slightly bent
processes in dry spines and a superficiality of reasoning
upon the subject have led to great overestimation of their
importance. As a matter of fact only a very few maladjustments
arise from deception of the palpater in this way,
though the profession contains few practitioners who make
a routine method of verifying by the transverses. The
reason is simple. Bent processes are caused by direct violence
applied before the union of shaft and epiphysis is
complete. Sufficient force to produce a change of direction
usually produces subluxation <em>in the same direction</em>.
Adjustment continued until the offending process was quite
aligned with its fellows would constitute overadjustment,
but adjustment is not usually continued after all symptoms
have subsided, so that actually small harm occurs through
failure to detect bending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>An epiphyseal plate may be absent, having been broken
off by trauma and absorbed. This can be discovered by
noting the too-wide space between apparently adjacent
vertebrae, and careful palpation will disclose the apparently
much anterior vertebra, an appearance not borne out by
the position of the transverses. When an epiphysis is absent
a patient has a somewhat weak back from lack of
muscular attachment.</p>

<p>Lipoma, or the heavy cicatrix following a burn or carbuncle,
may render palpation of two or three vertebrae
impossible. In such a case only the palpater’s experience
and his knowledge of the characteristics of various vertebrae
will enable him accurately to number the remainder.</p>

<p>Patients with much adipose tissue may require palpating
in several positions in order to permit certainty.</p>

<p>A deep third Cervical which is absolutely impalpable
may mislead one, but a careful count which shows one
vertebra overlooked indicates the necessity for a careful
re-examination of the Cervicals, by which the gap at the
third at least may be appreciated. If the Axis is very much
inferior the third is especially likely to be overlooked.</p>

<p>Anomalous cases have been found in which there were
more or less than the usual number of movable vertebrae,
the usual deviation being the presence of twenty-five, and
the extra one being most commonly a Lumbar. In one case
under my observation there were twenty-five movable vertebrae,
apparently thirteen Dorsals according to shape, and
only eleven pairs of ribs posteriorly, two pairs being dichotomous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
so that there appeared thirteen pairs anteriorly.
Deviations in number occur, in my experience, about once
in five hundred cases.</p>

<h3 id="h_21">LANDMARKS</h3>

<p>The regional location of vertebrae by means of certain
landmarks (so called) in or near the spine, is a much discussed
question in the profession. Without discussing the
various arguments in favor of this method, chief of which
is the <em>inability of the untrained to count vertebrae</em>, let us
set forth the principal landmarks used and the facts in
regard to them.</p>

<p>The seventh Cervical, called Vertebra Prominens, is usually
considered a guide to the count. In over three hundred
cases examined for that purpose the seventh Cervical was
found to be Vertebra Prominens in about 65%, the other
35% showing the sixth Cervical or first Dorsal to be the
prominent one. This method is two-thirds as accurate as
counting.</p>

<p>The tubercle (Chassaignac’s) of the sixth Cervical
transverse is said to be directly opposite the lower border
of the cricoid cartilage and this is a better guide than the
above.</p>

<p>The third Dorsal spinous process is said to be on a level
with the root of the spine of the scapula, and with arms
hanging at sides, the upper angle of the scapula to be on a
line between first and second Dorsal spinous process. This
is not at all constant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>The inferior angle of the scapula is said by some writers
to be on a line with the tip of the seventh Dorsal spine.
Others locate it opposite the interspace between seventh and
eighth Dorsals. Still others give it as opposite the eighth
Dorsal spine. All are correct—<em>sometimes</em>. In truth, the
inferior angle may be opposite any part of the spine between
the sixth and ninth Dorsals. There is nothing constant
about it.</p>

<p>The twelfth rib may be followed to its articulation with
the twelfth Dorsal vertebra. This is a good guide, providing
that the rib can be palpated. The lower margin of the last
rib is usually even with the spinous process of D 12 about
one inch and a half from the mid-spinal line. The humor
lies in the fact that the patient upon whom the count is so
difficult as to require this verification is usually obese and
obesity renders the rib impalpable.</p>

<p>The line drawn between the iliac crests falls between
the third and fourth Lumbar spinous processes in about
98% of all cases. <em>This is our most reliable landmark.</em> It
is used as described under the Count.</p>

<p>All landmarks except the last two show such variance
in different individuals as to be quite unreliable. The correct
method of numbering spinous processes is the obvious
and logical method—<em>count them</em>. The skill and accuracy
of touch required for successful counting is invaluable in
determining direction of subluxations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h_22">MENTAL ATTITUDE</h3>

<p>In order to secure that absolute concentration without
which it is impossible to appreciate properly those tactile
impressions for the very <em>reception</em> of which such continued
practice is necessary, the hands should leave the spine as
little as possible during palpation; a second person should
record subluxations found so that the palpater need only
state, and not write, his conclusions; light pressure on the
spine should always be used, as a heavy pressure desensitizes
nerve-endings in the fingers; and silence should be
maintained except for the necessary statement of points
to be recorded.</p>

<p>Palpate as rapidly as is consistent with good work. The
more rapid the palpation, <em>if concentration is absolute</em>, the
more accurate the impressions received.</p>

<p>The <em>end</em> and <em>aim</em> of palpation is to determine the means
by which impingement of nerves may be removed with the
greatest rapidity and success. Palpation includes such a
study of the vertebral column as will fix in your mind a
clear thought-picture of the impinged nerves throughout
its length.</p>

<h3>FINALLY</h3>

<p>If you would achieve success in Vertebral Palpation, be
persistent. Spare no labor to acquire that accuracy of
detail which distinguishes the expert from the amateur.
You can make of yourself what you will. There is no
limit to the ability which may be acquired. Another may
guide your hands but with <em>you</em> lies your success.</p>

<h2 id="h_23"><a id="NERVE-TRACING"></a>NERVE-TRACING</h2>
</div>

<h4>Definition</h4>

<p>Nerve-tracing is that branch of palpation by which the
tenderness of irritated spinal nerves is discovered and their
paths demonstrated.</p>

<h4 id="h_24">Organ-Tracing</h4>

<p>Organ-tracing is that branch of palpation which deals
with the outlining of the boundaries and surface markings
of a tender organ or part.</p>

<p>Palpaters frequently confuse tenderness of one of the
parenchymatous viscera for the tenderness of interlaced and
branching nerve filaments, especially in the abdominal region.
The fact that the tender area takes on the characteristic
shape of one of the viscera is conclusive evidence
that an organ, and not nerves, have been traced.</p>

<h4 id="h_25">What Nerves Traceable</h4>

<p>Any spinal nerve may be traceable for at least a part
of its course. The cranial nerves are made inaccessible to
palpation by their location, except the spinal portion of the
spinal accessory and the terminal portions of the nerves to
the face. Likewise the sympathetic trunks, except perhaps
in the neck, are untraceable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Nerve-tracing is comparatively easy in the upper and
lower extremities, neck and back. The superficial nerves of
the scalp are hard to follow on account of the hair. The
superficial nerves of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis are accessible
under the conditions mentioned below; the deep or
visceral branches, never.</p>

<p>Of those nerves mentioned as traceable, only such as
are <em>irritated</em> and consequently swollen and tender, can be
followed. If a nerve is very heavily impinged, especially if
the impingement be chronic, it is partially or wholly paralyzed
and not traceable. If the heavy impingement be
acute, or if there be a light impingement serving as a
mechanical irritant, nerve-tracing is a real aid to diagnosis.</p>

<h4>Proportion of Cases with Traceable Nerves</h4>

<p>About one-half of all the cases which visit Chiropractors
for adjustment are susceptible of nerve-tracing. In the
remaining half it is absolutely impossible to acquire any
information in this way. Of the half who are at all susceptible,
it is possible in perhaps four-fifths of all cases to
secure <em>some</em> accurate or reliable information.</p>

<p>The patient in whom all accessible nerves seem tender
to light palpation is hyperesthetic and unavailable for tracing.</p>

<p>In the usual case one or two nerves will be found easily
traceable, while the rest exhibit no tenderness on pressure.
Such a case furnishes the most reliable information securable
by this method and the tender nerves may be considered
as lightly or acutely impinged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<h4>Preconception of Nerves Essential</h4>

<p>Knowledge of the anatomy of the nervous system is a
part of the necessary equipment of the Chiropractor who
would trace nerves and this knowledge should be so thorough
as to enable the palpater to recognize each tender line
found as an anatomically described nerve-path or an error
on his part. The examiner must know the paths of all
nerves and be able to predict from the first tender points
discovered the probable course which the tenderness will
follow, so as to direct his search along that probable path.</p>

<p>He must be able to detect unconscious deception on the
part of the patient through his knowledge of the anatomical
impossibility of the apparent tracing. For instance, if for
any reason he may appear to have traced a nerve upward
beside the spinal column from D 10 to the eye by way of
the vertex, he must know that this is an illusion—because
such nerves do not exist and cannot be anatomically demonstrated—or
accept the well merited ridicule of any educated
person who discovers his absurdity.</p>

<p>Because of the difficulty of determining whether the
tender structure found be muscle, nerve, or viscus, and
because of the natural suggestibility of both palpater and
patient, nerve-tracing cannot be so reliable a guide to
nerve-paths as is dissection. It should not be necessary to
state this obvious truth but the calm acceptance, by many,
of the weird conclusions based upon a belief in the infallibility
of nerve-tracing testifies that it is necessary.</p>

<p>Nerve-tracing is valuable only where the nerve-path<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
outlined as being tender corresponds to the known path
of some nerve.</p>

<h4 id="h_26">Suggestion</h4>

<p>Paradoxically, knowledge of nerve-paths may lead to
error. By the law of expectancy, we are prone to find what
we look for and if we hold too strongly to the belief that
because we have found one or two points of tenderness we
must find a series of points extending along a mentally pictured
nerve-path, we may search until we falsely believe
that we have found this series.</p>

<p>Likewise the patient, having been carefully informed as
to the manner of procedure and knowing what we expect
to discover, may unconsciously deceive us by feeling tenderness
in response to suggestion, where no real impingement
exists.</p>

<h4 id="h_27">Place in Diagnosis</h4>

<p>The value of nerve-tracing in diagnosis has been much
overestimated by many, though the tendency of the profession
seems to be toward rationalism along that line.</p>

<p>Whereas, in palpation of the spine every real subluxation
gives evidence of disease, or tendency to disease, while
every normally aligned pair of vertebrae furnish proof that
no disease can exist in the area of distribution of the nerve
emerging between them, nerve-tracing is much less reliable.
If the tender nerve be traceable to a vertebral subluxation
it may be taken as additional evidence that the effect of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
subluxation is <em>disease</em>, rather than <em>tendency</em> to disease, truly
an important distinction, but scarcely broad enough to support
a diagnosis without aid.</p>

<p>The absence of tenderness from nerves does not negative
a disease in any instance, whereas the absence of subluxation
<em>does</em>. Like all other expedients for the selection of
vertebrae for adjustment without admitting the necessity for
first acquiring much skill by much labor, nerve-tracing has a
great weakness. Only irritated nerves are tender and the
effects of subluxation may be either irritation or paralysis.</p>

<p>If accurately done, sources of error carefully eliminated,
and the results of nerve-tracing found to correspond with
the condition of the spine and the other symptoms, this
method of demonstrating to the patient the connection between
the vertebrae and the diseased region of his body
is valuable. It aids in convincing him of the validity of
the Chiropractic theory.</p>

<h3 id="h_28">TECHNIC OF NERVE TRACING</h3>

<h4>Where to Begin</h4>

<p>The palpater, having made his vertebral palpation, may
begin at some point in the body indicated by the symptoms
as diseased and, finding tenderness, follow the path of a
nerve back to the spinal column where the nerve may be
fairly presumed to enter the intervertebral foramen.</p>

<p>Or he may use his palpation record as a guide and
follow the tender nerves outward to their periphery. This
is the better method.</p>

and marking of tender points.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<h4>Palpation as Guide</h4>

<p>When palpation has been made, remember that the impinged
nerve is usually found on the side opposite to the
direction of the spinous process in its departure from the
median line. With a left subluxation the tenderness is
usually, though not always, on the right side. If in the
Lumbar, and the subluxation a rotation, the impinged nerve
will be found <em>below</em> the transverse process of the subluxated
vertebra. In the Cervical and Dorsal regions the tender
nerve is usually below, but may be either above or below,
the transverse of the subluxated one.</p>

<p>Examine the nerves having exit from the foramina of
each subluxated vertebra in turn from above downward.
When a tender point is found about an inch from the mid-spinal
line, attempt to follow the nerve and palpate until
it has been traced as completely as possible.</p>

<h4>Where to Expect Tenderness</h4>

<p>The region immediately surrounding the spinous process
of the subluxated vertebra may be tender because of impingement
of the axons of the posterior primary division of
that spinal nerve which emerges below the vertebra. Such
tenderness is more common with anterior subluxations than
with others. It is not to be confused with the <em>soreness</em>
which often appears after adjustment and is due to bruising
or straining of the tissues.</p>

<p>Nerve tenderness may be discovered at a little distance
from the mid-spinal line and at a level slightly lower than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the emergence of the nerve. If a nerve is irritated, the
finger inserted between the ribs near their articulation with
the transverse processes will elicit tenderness. The discovery
of tender points along the spine is the most important
part of nerve-tracing.</p>

<h4>Nerve-Paths</h4>

<p>Detailed description of the paths of all the spinal nerves
may be studied from any standard work on anatomy and
will not be included here, but it may be well to remind the
reader of certain general tendencies.</p>

<p>The spinal nerves do not cross the median line in front
except perhaps fine interlacing fibres.</p>

<p>In the Dorsal region the nerves are usually found following
the interspaces until the lower ones debauch upon the
abdominal wall anteriorly. There are, however, some Dorsal
and lower Cervical nerve bundles which pass obliquely
downward and outward to innervate back muscles.</p>

<p>Reference to the section on Spino-Organic Connection
will make clear the tissues supplied by each nerve.</p>

<p><em>Slight</em> deviations from the usual course of nerves are
common; <em>marked</em> deviations very infrequent.</p>

<h4>Use of Fingers</h4>

<p>Use second finger of either hand for the palpating finger,
choosing the hand which can be most conveniently used as
determined by the position of patient and the part of the
body to be examined. There is no set rule. Reinforce this
second finger by the pressure upon it of the first and third
and, if desired, by pressing thumb against it. (See <a href="#ip_68">Fig. 5</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>Apply the tip of the palpating finger to the nerve with
a motion such that it crosses the path of the nerve at right
angles back and forth. Meanwhile the probable path of
the nerve must be kept in mind. As the finger crosses
the nerve-path it makes steady and even pressure upon any
structures passing beneath it. The motion of the hand is
almost a rolling motion, the finger tip probing, as it were,
for a tender spot.</p>

<h4>Tenderness—How Recognized</h4>

<p>The irritated condition of the nerve which has thus been
rolled beneath the finger may be recognized in one of three
ways; the patient may involuntarily flinch, betraying the
hurt; or he may inform the palpater of the hurt; or the
swollen, cord-like nerve may be felt.</p>

<p>The two former are the reliable guides, while the latter
is only occasionally possible. In children and in feeble-minded,
insane, or mute adults, the first mentioned method
must be relied upon entirely. Muscular contraction is the
unconscious or reflex response to pain and often occurs
independently of the intelligence or state of mind of the
subject.</p>

<p>Of all the three methods the one most commonly relied
upon is the second—the statements of the patient.</p>

<h4>Instruction to Patient</h4>

<p>The patient should be informed of your intentions when
palpation is begun and should be asked to answer every time
you apply your finger, saying, “Yes,” if the spot is tender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and, “No,” if not. He should speak promptly each time
so as to avoid self-deception which might come with reasoning
upon his sensations. Occasionally vary the steady
rhythm of your movements by omitting one and note if the
patient responds mechanically when you do not press.</p>

<p>At times during the tracing, it is well to depart from
the probable nerve-path and to touch again a point marked
as tender, to see if the patient’s information may be relied
upon. Whenever you leave the nerve-path his answer
should be, “No,” immediately changing to, “Yes,” when
you re-cross the tender line.</p>

<h4>Marking Tender Points</h4>

<p>At each tender point noted a small mark should be made
with an eye-brow pencil or other grease-paint, which leaves
a distinct but easily removable mark. These tender points
should be noted and marked at intervals of about an inch.</p>

<h4>Connecting Line</h4>

<p>When the entire nerve-path has been traversed in this
way, draw a line with the eye-brow pencil, passing through
all the marks indicating points of tenderness. This line
should be a sufficiently accurate rough outline of the nerve-path
to make clear the spinal connection with the diseased
area. The significance of this connection will be better
understood when the section on Spino-Organic Connection
has been studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<h4>Common Findings</h4>

<p>In muscular rheumatism, neuralgia, neuritis, or in case
of a local boil or abscess indicating local disturbance of the
trophic influence of nerves, clear and definite tracings are
common. Muscular spasm, such as wry-neck, usually has
a very tender nerve associated. Localized painful disease
of any kind is likely to be associated with a very definite
nerve tenderness, as is the case frequently with appendicitis,
ovaritis, hepatic colic, etc.</p>

<p>The painless disorders, or various disorders of spleen,
diaphragm, heart, lungs, etc., though they be of a very
serious nature, seldom are discoverable by nerve-tracing
unless their serous membranes are involved. Tracings <em>may</em>
be made from D 2 or 3 to anterior thoracic walls in heart
or lung disease but are not common.</p>

<p>Any spinal nerve may be traceable at times through at
least a part of its course.</p>

<h4>Sources of Error</h4>

<p>Several of these have been mentioned, such as the natural
suggestibility of both examiner and patient. Among
others are: failure in the back, thigh, or leg to reach the
really tender nerve because of the interposition of several
muscle layers between it and the finger, ignorance of nerve-paths,
failure to apply equal pressure to all parts of a nerve,
application of such heavy pressure that muscle tissue is
bruised and hurt, and failure of full co-operation on the
part of the patient. Let us consider these in turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>If several muscle layers interpose themselves between
the searching finger and the nerve, it is proper to push
aside the intervening layers, using a twisting and rolling
movement until the finger feels <em>underneath</em> the muscles.
This done, and a tender nerve found underneath several
muscle layers, the same amount of overlying tissue must
be pushed aside each time the finger searches for the nerve.
Only exhaustive study of the anatomy of the typical nervous
system will enable the examiner to know exactly at what
point a nerve will become more or less superficial. Unless
he does know this it is best to follow the neutral rule that
nerves tend to follow the long axes of ribs and limbs and
to maintain their depth beneath the surface throughout
their course. This statement is too general for accuracy.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that equal pressure be made on all
points palpated on one nerve. If the nerve pass over a
bone, <em>less force</em> is needed to exert the same pressure than
if it overlie muscle or other soft structure. The force used
varies constantly as the hand moves from place to place,
according to the density and hardness of the structures
overlying and underlying a nerve.</p>

<p>Sufficiently heavy pressure will elicit tenderness in all
except anaesthetic patients. But if a nerve be irritated it
will be tender without heavy pressure, when the finger really
makes a close contact with it.</p>

<p>If the patient willfully attempts to deceive the palpater,
nerve-tracing might as well be abandoned except in those
extreme cases where the patient will flinch against his will
on account of extreme sensitiveness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<h4>Use of Second Hand</h4>

<p>As far as possible, the second hand is placed opposite
the tracing hand and steadily supports the body; its position
changes with changes in the position of the first. If the
arm is to be examined it had best be held away from the
body, and the part to be examined held between the two
hands.</p>

<h4>Position of Patient</h4>

<p>For tracing nerves in the neck, back, and upper extremities,
the patient should sit easily. For lumbar, abdominal,
or pelvic tracing, or for tracing in the lower extremities,
have patient lie on side or back. Do not hesitate to
change the position of the patient as often as is necessary
to secure easy access to the part to be examined and relaxation
of the patient’s muscles. Never allow the assumption
of a strained position during tracing; the sensation of
cramped muscles may be confused with sensations of nerve
tenderness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_29"><a id="SUBLUXATIONS"></a>SUBLUXATIONS</h2>
</div>

<h4 id="h_30">Definition</h4>

<p>A vertebral subluxation is a displacement, less than a
dislocation, in which the chief element is the partial loss
of normal apposition of the articular surfaces of the subluxated
vertebra with those of the vertebra above or below,
or both. Or, Vertebral subluxation is a permanent partial
dislocation.</p>

<h4>How Produced</h4>

<p>Subluxations are primarily caused by trauma—falls,
blows, strains, etc., being the chief factors. Hereditary
weakness in structure of some part predisposes by rendering
that portion more easily displaced.</p>

<p>Subluxations are never hereditary but may be congenital
through violent or instrumental delivery into the world or
may <em>appear</em> hereditary because they occur shortly after birth
through the effect of light jars upon the hereditarily weakened
segments of the spinal column.</p>

<p>They are always the result of concussions of forces;
never of forces acting entirely <em>within</em> the organism. They
result from the contact of the body with its environment.</p>

<p>It has been said that muscular action in response to
peripheral irritation may produce subluxation. The laws
of reflex action render this impossible. Given a normally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
aligned vertebra, and consequently normal nerves and a
normal reflex arc in that segment, the ventral horn cells
respond to a <em>slight</em> peripheral stimulus by exciting muscular
contraction on the <em>same</em> side with the irritation. If the irritation
be sufficiently increased, the response occurs on <em>both</em>
sides but most strongly on the side from which the irritation
comes. Greater irritation merely serves to cause greater
distribution of the responsive action. (See any standard
physiology on reflex action.) In no case will the difference
between the contractions of muscles on the two sides be
sufficient to displace a normally aligned vertebra. Nature
has provided against that contingency.</p>

<p>Given a subluxated vertebra causing nerve impingement
and thus interruption of the normal action of the reflex arc,
irritation may result in greater contraction upon the <em>opposite</em>
side than upon the side of the irritation. This is an
abnormal condition and accounts for the <em>increase</em> of previously
existing subluxations under pain or peripheral irritation.
But in every instance trauma must and does precede
and cause subluxation.</p>

<h4>Reaction of Secondary Causes</h4>

<p>Once produced, however, a subluxation may not cause
noticeable effect until it has been <em>increased</em> in degree by the
reaction of forces within the body such as poisons, general
fever, etc. Thus germs, dietetic errors, exposure to sudden
temperature changes, waste of energy through abnormal
mental activities, as hate, fear, worry, etc., or through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
physical excess—in fact, all the <em>secondary</em> causes of disease
may <em>appear</em> to have produced a subluxation. In fact, they
have merely accentuated that which already existed and
have done so through the muscular contractions which they
induced.</p>

<p>General thinning of intervertebral substance through a
condition of disturbed metabolism itself produced through
the agency of some <em>one</em> serious subluxation, may narrow all
the foramina and increase impingement of nerves at any
point where a slight subluxation previously existed. An
irritated nerve may become swollen and the nerve impinged
at the foramen.</p>

<h4 id="h_31">Law Governing Location</h4>

<p>So definite is the law governing the effect of force applied
to a given portion of the body upon an associated vertebral
segment that the skilled Chiropractor who has studied vertebrate
segmentation thoroughly may determine, from the
history of a fall or injury, the vertebra which would tend to
be subluxated by that injury and the tissues controlled from
that part. The rule is this:</p>

<p><em>Force applied to any body segment tends to subluxate
the segmentally associated vertebra. This subluxation tends
to produce disease throughout the area of distribution of the
subjacent pair of spinal nerves.</em></p>

<p>The task of explaining this law seems hopeless unless
the student is familiar with human embryology and the life
history of the vertebrata, as well all the details of human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
anatomy. To such a student the law will be self-evident, so
interwoven with the threads of higher organization as practically
to form its pattern.</p>

<p>In simple terms we might offer this general statement.
Any force applied to the body with sufficient violence will
produce subluxation of the vertebra above the spinal nerves
supplying the injured area. Thus, the brachial plexus controls
the arm and shoulder and connects with the spine by
way of the 5, 6, 7, 8, Cervical and 1 Dorsal nerves. Any
force striking the arm or shoulder tends to produce subluxation
of the sixth or seventh Cervical or first Dorsal vertebra
so that all permanent disease conditions resulting will be
found in the arm or shoulder or nearby tissues of the
neck.</p>

<p>This theme presents a magnificent field for individual
study and research but is, per se, beyond the limitations set
for this work.</p>

<h4>Effect of Subluxations</h4>

<p>Slight subluxations may exist, because of the adaptation
of surrounding parts and the slight play within the intervertebral
foramen, without producing noticeable effect. They
always, however, evidence a <em>tendency</em> to disease.</p>

<p>The majority of subluxations do produce disease, to
some degree, and do so by <em>impinging nerves</em>. Impingement
may be either by pressure <em>against</em> a nerve or ganglion or by
<em>constriction</em> of a nerve where it passes through an intervertebral
foramen; the former occurs in the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Cervical sympathetic, the sub-occipital nerves, and the sacral
nerves; the latter is the commoner form in Dorsal and
Lumbar regions of the spine. Probably the most positive
constriction of a nerve which can occur within the body is to
be found in rotation of Lumbar vertebrae; the body of the
rotated vertebra encroaches upon the inferior nerve on the
side opposite to the direction taken by the spinous process.</p>

<p>Either variety of impingement produces disease, morbid
structure or function, by irritation of the nerve: light impingement
irritates, heavy impingement partially or completely
paralyzes, the nerve.</p>

<h3 id="h_32">VARIETIES OF SUBLUXATION</h3>

<p>According to the abnormal relations between vertebrae
subluxations may be variously described as rotated, tipped,
anteriorly, posteriorly, or laterally displaced. They commonly
combine two or more of these forms, so that the
purely rotary or the entirely lateral subluxation is uncommon.</p>

<h4>Rotation</h4>

<p>Every vertebra has a vertical axis around which it tends
to rotate. This axis is not always the center of mass but
depends upon the arrangement of mass, the fixity of
cartilages, ligaments, and muscles, which tend to hold some
parts of the vertebra more fixed than others, and the apposition
of articular processes, which tends to prevent movement
in certain directions.</p>

<p>The axis of rotation of the first Cervical is the center of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the odontoid process of the second Cervical, which articulates
with the transverse ligament and anterior arch of the first.
A frequent subluxation of the Atlas is a rotation around this
process so that the one transverse is permanently posterior
to its normal position and the other correspondingly anterior.</p>

<p>The axis of rotation of the Cervicals below the Atlas is
in the extreme anterior portion of their bodies. This part
remains relatively fixed in rotatory subluxation while the tip
of the spinous process describes the greatest arc.</p>

<p>In the Dorsals the axis of rotation lies in the posterior
portion of the centrum near the neural canal. When the
spinous process appears laterally displaced in rotation the
anterior portion of the body is slightly displaced in the opposite
direction, twisting and straining the fibres of the
intervertebral disk.</p>

<p>In the Lumbar region rotation is the commonest form
of subluxation, the axis of rotation being laterally movable
upon a transverse line between the articular processes in
the beginning and shifting, as soon as the vertebra leaves its
normal relations, to the junction of the articular process
with that of the adjacent vertebra on the side toward which
the spinous process is moving. Thus, in rotation of the
vertebra so that the spinous is to the right, the axis will be
found on the right side, the superior articular process of the
next vertebra serving as a support on which the inferior
articular process of the rotating vertebra may turn. The
processes are so firmly locked that unless the whole vertebra
be quite posterior little lateral movement of the spinous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
process is possible without marked rotation. The body
describes the greatest arc because it is further removed from
the center of rotation than is the tip of the spinous.</p>

<h4>Tipping</h4>

<p>This is a subluxation in which the one transverse process
is, or appears to be, superior or inferior to the other. It
occurs frequently to the Atlas in combination with lateral
subluxation. In fact, the shape of the occipito-atlantal
articulations is such that, if the remaining Cervicals maintain
their proper relation to each other, the Atlas cannot be
laterally displaced without a certain amount of tipping. It
will be relatively superior on the prominent side and the
head will be tipped toward that side; that is toward the
side of the lateral displacement. Thus, on account of the
wedge-shaped lateral masses, if the whole Atlas be to the
right of its normal position the right side will be superior
and the head tipped toward the right. This is only true
when the vertebrae below maintain a normal interrelation.</p>

<h4>Approximation</h4>

<p>This is a name applied to that condition in which, on
account of changes in the intervertebral disks due to subluxation
interfering with metabolic processes, the bodies or
spinous processes of vertebrae are crowded too closely
together.</p>

<p>Occasionally a spine is found in which, on palpation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the spinous processes are found to be crowded together in
groups, sometimes of two or three, sometimes of five or six;
no two interspaces appear equal, a very wide one being
succeeded by one or two which are almost inappreciable;
the variation in width of the interspaces does not correspond
to the known normal variation in those regions where
the changing obliquity of spinous processes should modify
the relative width of successive spaces. We expect, for
instance, to find a wider space between third and fourth
Dorsals than between second and third; if we do not find
this difference it is doubtless due to cartilage change and
the vertebrae are approximated.</p>

<p>In case of general thinning of intervertebral substance
unequally divided between different sections of the spine the
record will show that almost every vertebra is listed either
S or I, and if a system of underscoring is used that these
two directions are frequently indicated as most noticeable.</p>

<p>A study of the spine will make clear the fact that if the
cartilage between any two Dorsal vertebrae be thinned in
front the bodies of the vertebrae will be closer together and
the spinous processes more widely separated; the spinous
process of the upper vertebra will be crowded against the
one superior to it and that of the lower against the one
inferior to it. These spinous processes are said to be <em>approximated</em>.</p>

<p>The correction of S or I subluxations, then, depends
upon correction of disturbed nutritive processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<h4>Lateral Displacements</h4>

<p>According to the usage of earlier writers on subluxations
this term (lateral displacement) included rotation of
the vertebra as well as those changes in position in which
the whole or nearly all of the vertebra deviates sidewise
from its normal position. Since the introduction of the
term “rotation” into the description of subluxations, the
meaning of the term “lateral displacement” is much more
restricted. It refers now to a condition which probably
occurs in the strictest sense only in the Cervical region, most
frequently with the first and second Cervical, the two being
subluxated together.</p>

<p>We have already stated that the most important fact to
be determined regarding the Atlas is its lateral displacement,
since this produces the greatest impingement of nerves.
Lateral displacement of any other Cervical can best be
judged by examination of the transverse processes, since
by palpation of the spinous process alone it is quite impossible
to distinguish between lateral and rotary subluxation.</p>

<p>In the Dorsal and Lumbar regions the R or L used to
describe the position of the spinous process most often
indicates rotation of the vertebra. While it is perfectly
proper thus to describe the subluxation on a record, in the
determining of the form of adjustment to be used the position
of the <em>whole</em> vertebra must be considered.</p>

<h4>Anterior Subluxations</h4>

<p>Forward displacements may occur anywhere in the
spine. In the case of the first Cervical they are usually,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
though not always, forward displacements of only one side—rotation—though
the whole Atlas may be anterior if the
Axis has moved with it or is tipped so that the spinous process
is much superior. This is rare.</p>

<p>Any Cervical may be anterior; usually a series are
anterior (if any) amounting to an increase in the Cervical
curve—a lordosis. This condition may be corrected by
transverse adjustments given from the front and side.</p>

<p>A Dorsal vertebra is only <em>relatively</em> anterior, the adjacent
ones being relatively posterior, and the only possible correction
at present is the adjustment of the posterior ones.
A Lumbar cannot be anterior unless those below it are also
anterior, on account of the locking of articulations. Discovery
of anterior Lumbars is quite common. The fifth
Lumbar may be subluxated anteriorly by slipping forward
on the Sacrum; it must be <em>superior</em> at the same time, on
account of the shape of the articulating surfaces which face
downward and forward. The spinous process is crowded
closely against the fourth while the body of the fifth is too
widely separated from that of the fourth.</p>

<h4>Posterior Subluxations</h4>

<p>There are many Chiropractors who have always considered
the posterior subluxation more than any other, not
because it produces greater nerve impingement than others
but because it is easiest to detect; it intrudes itself upon the
attention of the unskilled examiner most persistently. Nor
should its importance be underestimated, though we now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
realize that in some instances a rotated or anterior vertebra
may cause more nerve impingement than a posterior one.</p>

<p>The posterior subluxation in the lower Dorsals and
Lumbars is the easiest variety to adjust; in this region a
posterior displacement of one vertebra tends to bring with
that one the next adjacent superior one, the sharpest deviation
occurring between the posterior one and the one below
it.</p>

<p>Any vertebra may be posterior: the Atlas is rarely so
as a whole, and never unless the Axis is also displaced
backward; the Cervical and Dorsal regions present frequent
variations of this sort, which must not, however, be confused
with long, prominent, or overdeveloped spinous processes;
the Sacrum may be posterior to the ilium on one side,
or to both ilia.</p>

<h4>Occipital Subluxations</h4>

<p>Mention should be made here of a form of subluxation
not strictly vertebral—displacement between the condyles of
the occipital bone and the lateral masses of the Atlas. This
occurs when the head has been moved too violently upon
the Atlas so as to cause an immediate nerve irritation and
muscle tension sufficient to hold it in its abnormal position.
The Cervicals may be quite normal below the Atlas though
this, of course, is not the rule. Correction of occipital subluxations
is made by applying force to the Atlas and to the
skull, sometimes by holding Atlas and rotating the skull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<h4>Age of Subluxations</h4>

<p>The relative age of subluxations may be determined,
within rather wide limits, it is true, by a study of the form
of the spinous process. Newly acquired subluxations are
sharply defined, having noticeable <em>edges</em> on the spinous
process. In time they tend to become rounded and blunt
and appear to cover more surface, just as the mountain
range which, when first upheaved, is sharp and rugged,
gradually rounds into regular curves through the work of
the elements.</p>

<p>In this way Nature protects the subluxated vertebra
from further contact with the environment surrounding
man, the rounded process offering less opportunity for a
blow or shock to affect it.</p>

<h4>Changes in Shape</h4>

<p>Bone diseases such as rachitis osteomalacia, etc., and
especially Potts’ Disease, or spinal caries, make marked
changes in the shape of vertebrae. Also a subluxated
vertebra may gradually assume a shape suited to the abnormal
position it occupies, the commonest change being
the assumption of a wedge shape by the centrum. This is
a great obstacle to adjustment, as the abnormal shape of the
vertebra makes it tend to settle after each movement into
the old abnormal position.</p>

<p>There are few spines without some more or less misshapen
vertebrae.</p>

<p>Ankylosis also makes great changes in the shape of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
vertebrae. There are two kinds of ankylosis—true and
false. The first is a deposit of bone cells upon bone, often
the formation of a bridgelike structure to hold contiguous
vertebrae together. This may bind any portions of the
vertebrae but most commonly holds the bodies, in which
case it can only be appreciated by detecting the lack of
movement between normally separable vertebrae. False
ankylosis occurs with fever in bone and consists in an
exudation of bone substance which sometimes produces
remarkable distortions of shape.</p>

<h4>Definitions</h4>

<p>Vertebral Adjusting is the art of correcting by hand
the malpositions of subluxated vertebrae.</p>

<p>A Vertebral Adjustment, strictly speaking, should mean
the complete restoration of normal relation between previously
subluxated vertebrae. As used in Chiropractic, it
means either a partial or complete restoration of such normal
relation.</p>

<p>Maladjustment, as used in the profession, designates any
movement of vertebrae by hand which produces or increases
subluxation.</p>

<h3 id="h_34">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ADJUSTING</h3>

<p>It will be well for the student to master first the general
rules and principles which govern vertebral adjustment and
then to proceed to a detailed investigation of each movement,
in turn, before practicing it. The art of adjusting
can only be acquired by practice, and a high degree of excellence
in it only by <em>long-continued</em> practice. However, the
rapidity with which it can be mastered depends largely upon
the formation of a clear pre-conception of the work to be
done and the manner of its doing.</p>

<p>As the student progresses in the art he finds himself
occasionally guilty of errors which mar, in some degree,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the efficiency of his work. These may arise from unconscious
modification of the technic first learned or from
unconscious repetition of some necessary modification demanded
by a special peculiarity in one or more cases.</p>

<p>This section is intended to furnish the proper pre-conception
and also to serve as a monitor to adjusters who, by
reference to the precepts herein set down, may discover and
remedy their own errors. It is not intended to furnish
sufficient education to warrant practice without clinical instruction,
which is unwarrantable, but rather to accelerate
the education which practice alone can furnish.</p>

<h4>Object of Adjustment</h4>

<p>The vertebral subluxation being an abnormality of
<em>relation</em> between vertebrae, it is obvious that its correction
must be a return of normal relation. This can only be accomplished
by bringing about a change of <em>relative</em> position.
Movement of a section of the spine composed of several
vertebrae is not, in the true sense, an Adjustment. It is the
<em>single</em> vertebra which must be moved.</p>

<p>The movement should be one calculated to bring the
vertebra to its normal position <em>in the most direct manner
possible</em>. Such a movement should be used as will reverse
the direction of the forces which subluxated the vertebra.
It should be applied to the transverse or spinous processes,
or to the lamina, as is sometimes done in the case of the
Atlas, according to the <em>kind</em> of subluxation. Different subluxations
require different handling. Cases vary. Select<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the move <em>best suited to the case</em>. This can be determined
most properly by correct palpation which fixes in the mind
of the adjuster the position of every part of the vertebra,
its relation to its fellows, the points of greatest nerve impingement,
etc., all of which should suggest the best method
for correction.</p>

<p>The prime object of adjustment is the removal of impingement
from nerves.</p>

<h4>Transmitted Shock vs. Thrust</h4>

<p>The movement used in adjusting has been variously
described. Many writers and teachers have used the term
“thrust” to describe the movement of the hands, and the
term is correctly applied to the movement used by many
Chiropractors. But a careful study of the methods of applying
force in use among the most successful adjusters,
those who have attained the greatest results with the slightest
percentage of failures and a minimum of pain to the
patient, discloses the fact that the chief element of their
adjustment is <em>transmitted shock</em>.</p>

<p>The hand is held in close contact with the vertebra to be
adjusted and the arms and shoulders describe such movements
as to deliver the required amount of force with the
slightest possible change in the position of the hands. The
vertebra bounds away from the contact hand. In the delivery
of a <em>thrust</em> the hand would follow the vertebra, forcing each
portion of the movement. The real effect of a thrusting
motion, since the hand cannot enter the body as a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
instrument would, is that of <em>pushing</em>. Pushing neither
subluxates nor adjusts vertebrae so readily as does a rapidly
applied shock.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate with a common experiment in physics.
Suspend a number of ivory balls by cords of equal length
in such a manner that each is in contact with its fellow and
all are in a straight line. When the balls are properly adjusted
a straight line should connect their centers. Hold one
end ball firmly in the hand or with an instrument which
renders it absolutely fixed. Then strike sharply with a
light hammer. The balls will all remain stationary except
the one on the opposite end which will fly off to a distance
exactly measurable according to the force of the blow.
How does this occur?</p>

<p>A shock is transmitted through the molecules of the ivory
until it reaches the end ball, which is not held back by another.
Here the transmitted force is expended in molar
motion, the ball leaping away from its fellows as if it had
been hung alone and had been struck with the same force.</p>

<p>It is well known that by placing an elbow firmly against
a man’s jaw and then sharply striking the closed fist with
the other hand, open, a very heavy blow can be given; yet
the forearm, through which the shock is transmitted, does
not move.</p>

<p>Now ivory is very like human bone. Further, it has been
demonstrated that the law illustrated by the above experiment
is equally applicable to the movement of vertebrae.
The pushing or thrusting movement <em>may</em> move a specific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
vertebra, but it is probable that the chief factor in so doing
is the element of transmitted shock contained in the movement
and delivered at the instant of release of the hand from
the spine at the end of the movement.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is obvious that a pushing or
thrusting movement may move several vertebrae in addition
to the one directly in contact with the adjusting hand, in
consequence of the way in which the spinal segments are
closely bound together. If a steady strain is used, in which
muscles and ligaments have time to act, one of three results
may occur: (a) the specific adjustment; (b) the movement
of several vertebrae at one time, which does not constitute
an adjustment; (c) the giving way of the spine at
its weakest point, which may be some distance from the
point of contact with the adjusting hand, the ligaments and
muscles having communicated and diffused the strain
throughout a large area. In the latter contingency the
result is usually a new subluxation or the increase of an
old one, instead of an adjustment.</p>

<h4>The Rapid Movement</h4>

<p>Thus <em>Speed</em> becomes an important factor in correct adjustment.</p>

<p>A good illustration of the value of speed may be taken
from a pile of stakes bound together by a cord. If a man
with a hammer desires to remove the center stake of the
group, and attempts to do so with a slow pushing movement,
the result is a change of position of many stakes, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
adhere to the center stake and to each other. If, on the
contrary, he strikes a sharp, quick blow with his hammer,
meeting squarely the center of balance of the one stake, it
will fly straight from its position leaving the others unmoved.
This is exactly what we desire to accomplish with an adjustment.
By the speed of the movement we expect to
move <em>one</em> vertebra before adhesion or the contraction of
muscles or inelasticity of ligaments can diffuse the force.</p>

<h4>Close Contact</h4>

<p>In order to accomplish the transmitted shock it would
seem wisest, at first thought, to draw back the hand and
strike the vertebra sharply. On the contrary, it has been
found advisable to place the hand carefully in <em>close</em> and
<em>immediate contact</em> with the vertebra to be adjusted. Nature
herself shows us the way in the delicate shock-transmitting
mechanism of the tympanum.</p>

<p>Also the hand of the adjuster will cover much more
than merely the spinous or transverse process which is used
as a lever and to which it is desired to transmit the shock,
unless carefully placed so that only a <em>small portion</em> is in
contact; by such a contact diffusion of the shock is prevented
and its efficiency within a limited area is increased. A carpenter
wishing to countersink a nail places in contact with
the nail head a small instrument called a countersink, which
he then strikes sharply with a hammer. The contact hand
of the adjuster represents the countersink and is used by the
two arms as a passive instrument for transmitting shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>The close contact of the hand, which remains passive,
renders the adjustment much less painful to the patient than
it would otherwise be, and one of the prime objects in the
mind of the adjuster should be the minimizing of pain inflicted,
by any means which does not lessen the resulting
benefit. Also any drawing back of the hand before the
movement warns the patient and tends to induce involuntary
muscular contraction which interferes with adjustment.</p>

<h4>Relaxation</h4>

<p>In an adjustment it is necessary to overcome two kinds
of resistance—the passive resistance of inertia, of ligaments,
or of superincumbent weight, and the active resistance of
muscular contraction. It is important that both forms be
minimized.</p>

<p>The first may be lessened through the position of the
patient’s body; he is placed so that the vertebra to be adjusted
is in the freest possible position. The second is reduced
to the least possible quantity, amounting to no more
than muscle tonus, by using two methods: (a) Oral Suggestion,
and (b) Muscular Suggestion.</p>

<h4>Oral Suggestion</h4>

<p>Explain to the patient the need for relaxation. Make it
clear to him that less force will be required if his muscles
are passive. Remind him frequently of this and assume that
he desires to relax. A word immediately before the adjustment
often induces a temporary relaxation during which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the adjustment is given. Anything which detracts the
attention from the coming shock is an aid. Sometimes asking
the patient to inhale and exhale slowly and deeply will
sufficiently take his attention from the adjustment. Experience
will teach him that he suffers less pain when relaxed
and presently relaxation becomes a habit. Instructing
patients to think of sleep, turning the eyeballs upward, has
been effective with some.</p>

<h4>Muscular Suggestion</h4>

<p>This can only be given by maintaining a state of relaxation
in one’s own muscles, which in itself is desirable in
most cases, for reasons to be presently explained. In handling
Cervical vertebrae move the head gently from side to
side with your own hands relaxed as much as possible. The
lazy motion suggests relaxation. Then when it is felt that
the neck is thoroughly relaxed, vary the motion with a quick
adjusting movement.</p>

<p>In Dorsal and Lumbar regions after the hands are in
correct position the adjuster should pause a moment both
to be sure that the direction of movement and his purpose
to move are clearly fixed in his mind and to be certain that
both himself and the patient are relaxed. The adjustment is
given instantly and from a perfectly lax muscle, as a boxer
strikes.</p>

<p>An added advantage is the greater amount of speed and
control which may be commanded in this way. The lax
arm, being in a neutral state as regards motion, can be contracted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
in any desired direction without loss of force or of
time, whereas a taut muscle cannot further effect motion of
the arm without relaxation of its antagonistic muscles, which
takes time.</p>

<h4>Muscular Control</h4>

<p>Considerable contral over one’s own muscles is necessary
in order perfectly to relax arm and shoulder muscles
just before the adjustment and then to utilize a measured
and determined quantity of force in a desired direction. To
acquire this much practice is necessary—practice on the living
subject. The desired end may be hastened, however, by
acquiring the abstract property of muscular control or by
developing control already gained.</p>

<p>Many different forms of exercise will aid in the acquisition
of muscular control and the ability to relax and
then to follow the relaxation with an instantaneous whiplike
contraction in a given direction. The best of these is
without doubt <em>bag-punching</em>. The movements employed
with a punching-bag, especially the lateral quadruple movement
with both elbows and both hands, tend to develop
precisely the sort of control needed for correct adjusting.
The beginner can do no better than to practice in this way,
by which, it must be remembered, only a necessary <em>property</em>,
and not by any means the exact movement, may be acquired.</p>

<h4>Amount of Force</h4>

<p>The amount of force used in an adjustment varies so
much in different spines and in different parts of the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
spine that it is quite impossible to state any correct estimate
of it in terms of physical units. In general the Cervicals
move with least resistance, then the Dorsals, then the Lumbars,
and finally the Sacrum and Ilia as hardest of all to
displace or replace.</p>

<p>In developing additional force when it is found that
the force first used on any vertebra has been insufficient to
move it, remember this law: <em>Work equals one-half Mass
times the square of the Velocity</em>. In other words, doubling
the speed of the movement increases its effectiveness four-fold;
tripling it, nine-fold.</p>

<p>The increase in force should never be effected by increasing
the <em>weight</em> or <em>pressure</em> upon the patient’s body, for
reasons which should be clear from a study of previous
pages, but always by increasing the <em>speed</em> of the movement.</p>

<h4>Names Used to Describe Movements</h4>

<p>The names herein employed to indicate certain movements,
each a well-defined method of procedure for the
accomplishment of some special end, are the names or descriptive
terms which seem to be in the most general use at
this time. Few of these movements have arrived suddenly;
most of them are the result of gradual growth and evolution:
so with the terms by which they are known; they have
gradually become a part of the common language of the
profession. Usage sanctions them, though some of them are
cumbersome, unwieldy, or entirely inappropriate.</p>

<h3 id="h_35">SPECIAL TECHNIC</h3>

<h3>MORIKUBO MOVE</h3>

<p>A movement for the correction of a lateral and rotated
Atlas, indicated for use only when the Atlas is recorded as
R. A. or L. A. The position of the patient’s head renders
the transverse process inaccessible unless it be anterior on
the side from which adjustment is to be given.</p>

<h4>Position of Patient</h4>

<p>Place two sections of the bifid bench together so as to
secure the effect of a solid bench with an upward sloping
front. Have patient lying on back with back of head resting
firmly on bench, chin slightly uptilted. Then turn patient’s
head so that it faces sidewise and rests flatly on the side of
the least prominent transverse. This exposes the anterior
transverse in front of the tendons of the sterno-mastoid
muscle.</p>

<h4>Use of Hands</h4>

<p>Stand leaning over head of bench and carefully place
the pisiform bone of adjusting hand upon the tip of the
transverse process, being careful to push aside the sterno-mastoid
tendons if they interpose themselves between the
pisiform and the process. The fingers of the adjusting
hand extend downward toward the clavicle and rest lightly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
very lightly, upon the patient’s neck. With the other hand
firmly grip the wrist of the adjusting hand, fitting the pisiform
of the upper hand into the hollow below the styloid
process of the radius.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>This is delivered straight downward toward the bench.
It should be light and quick and the hand should not follow
the process in its movement.</p>

<p>This movement is painful and should not be used if
avoidable. When used it requires the utmost care and a
careful measuring of force. Err, if at all, on the side of
overcaution. The technic will be better understood after
study of the more detailed description of “The Recoil”,
since the position and use of hands, arms, and shoulders is
much the same for both.</p>

<h3>PISIFORM ANTERIOR CERVICAL MOVE</h3>

<p>Indicated for rotation of a Cervical vertebra in which one
transverse process is anterior to its normal position or more
anterior than its fellow which may also be somewhat, though
less, anterior.</p>

<h4>Placing Patient</h4>

<p>As for the Morikubo Move place the patient in the dorsal
recumbent posture with head resting on bench and chin
uptilted. Turn patient’s face slightly away from the side of
the selected anterior transverse and steady the head with the
free hand while palpating.</p>

<div id="ip_100" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 8. Pisiform anterior Cervical move.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h4>Making Contact</h4>

<p>Palpate downward from the Atlas transverse along the
posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, dipping deeply into
the neck and exploring with the tips of the first three fingers
until the offending process is felt as a nodule of bone plainer
to the touch than those above and below. Always reach
<em>across</em> the neck to the selected transverse; if it be the right,
stand on the patient’s left and use left hand for palpating
and for contact hand as well.</p>

<p>Having found the process, gently move aside any tissues
which tend to interpose between the finger and the bone,
change hands so that the palpating hand is free and the
other holds the contact spot clear of interposed tissue and
plainly points it out, then place pisiform bone of contact
hand gently but firmly against the <em>front</em> of the process so
that a mass of bone is felt between the pisiform and the
bench when downward pressure is made.</p>

<h4>Completing Position</h4>

<p>It will be noted here that the head is unstable and tends
to rock with slight pressure or movement of the contact
hand. Steady the head by placing the knee upon head of
bench and against side of patient’s head, not roughly but
so that the head cannot move further toward the adjuster.</p>

<p>Now reinforce the contact hand by gripping the wrist
with the other, press slightly downward to tighten the contact
and avoid slipping, and you are ready for</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<h4>The Movement</h4>

<p class="in0">which is directed sharply <em>downward</em> toward the bench. This
move rotates the vertebra around its vertical axis and puts
a strain in a backward direction on the whole column at
this point.</p>

<p>Care must be used, because the move at best is painful.
It is easy to slip across the end of the transverse. Take every
precaution to avoid imprisoning a muscle, nerve, or blood-vessel
between the contact hand and the vertebra. Rightly
used this move is valuable, perhaps most valuable of all
anterior Cervical moves, but it requires nice judgment.</p>

<h3>LAST FINGER CONTACT</h3>

<p>This movement differs from the preceding one in two
important particulars; the contact hand must be so selected
with relation to the side of vertebra adjusted that the fingers
will extend upward toward the patient’s head, and the opposing
hand supports the head instead of reinforcing the contact
hand.</p>

<h4>Placing Patient</h4>

<p>As for preceding move. The head will remain in this
position only until the contact is made, after which it will be
raised by the supporting hand until a tight contact is felt and
the neck muscles drawn fairly taut.</p>

<div id="ip_102" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 9. Last finger contact for anterior Cervical.</div></div>

<h4>Making Contact</h4>

<p>Palpate with left hand if standing on patient’s left to
adjust a right, anterior subluxation. Find the offending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
anterior transverse, draw tissues away with middle finger of
palpating hand, change to middle finger of free hand which
marks and holds the point of contact. Now place (with
care) the base of the little finger of the hand which was
used for palpating, at a point just below the condyle of the
last metacarpal and a little to the palmar side, in direct contact
with the front of the transverse. The last finger will be
flexed toward the radial side and a shallow depression thus
left for the contact.</p>

<h4>Completing Position</h4>

<p>Hold contact lightly and slip the free hand under the
patient’s head, which faces slightly toward the adjuster.
Raise the head, bending the neck away from the adjusting
hand and toward patient’s chest until it is felt that the
contact is secure and that further movement would put the
neck upon a strain. You are ready for</p>

<h4>The Movement</h4>

<p class="in0">which is delivered entirely with contact hand, downward
and toward the back of the neck. The delivery is difficult
because the force arm is flexed at the elbow and the position
awkward. Practice, however, will soon render one adept.</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>For rotated vertebrae which have one transverse anterior
to the other, Cervicals only. This move gives a slightly less
advantageous force angle than the preceding, but is less
likely to be painful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<h3>SECOND METACARPAL CONTACT</h3>

<h4>Position of Patient</h4>

<p>Place patient supine on bench so that his head extends
beyond the end of bench and is supported by the upraised
knee of the palpater. Stand at head of bench so as to face
patient’s feet.</p>

<h4>Use of Hands</h4>

<p>Differing from their use in the preceding moves the
hands are so placed that the adjusting hand for a right,
anterior subluxation will be right hand, for a left anterior
the left hand. The opposite hand supports the head after
contact is made.</p>

<h4>Making Contact</h4>

<p>Contact point on hand is second metacarpal at the end of
the condyle, or second metacarpo-phalangeal joint. This is
placed in front of the offending transverse, the head having
been rotated away from that side and other tissues drawn
carefully aside from the bone. The back of the hand is
downward toward the clavicle, fingers semi-flexed on palm,
thumb resting on jaw.</p>

<h4>Supporting Head</h4>

<p>The following position is the correct one for supporting
the head in all Cervical adjustments delivered in the above
position of patient and adjuster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>Cup the supporting hand slightly and fit the patient’s
ear into the cupped palm. Let fingers extend toward the
base and back of the neck, the finger position varying according
to the amount of rotation of the head so that the
fingers are in all cases directly <em>under</em> the head weight. The
wrist then flexes on the hand, and wrist and forearm are
brought up across the patient’s forehead so that a force
delivered from the opposite side cannot cause the head to roll
or move upon the supporting hand. After placing both
hands draw the head so that the chin is tilted upward until
it is felt that contact is snug and tight. This supporting
position is invaluable and much neglected by adjusters, who
might save themselves much annoyance and many failures
by its constant use. In the study of succeeding Cervical
moves refer to this description frequently. We shall call it
the Hook Support, because the arm and hand resemble a
hook which grasps the under side of the head and curves
over the upper.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>This is delivered entirely with contact hand and in a
direction as much posterior as can be achieved without
slipping past the end of the process. If the head is sufficiently
rotated away from the contact side the angle of force is
better than with a straight lateral adjustment, which it somewhat
resembles, but not so good for anteriors as either of
the two preceding moves. It is chiefly useful when the other
two fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<h3>OCCIPITO—ATLANTAL MOVE</h3>

<p>To move an Atlas so disposed that its one side is posterior
while the whole vertebra is laterally displaced in the same
direction; to move, for instance, an Atlas R. P.</p>

<p>Have patient lying on back in position C with head projecting
beyond bench and supported by adjuster’s knee.</p>

<h4>Placing of Hands</h4>

<p>Place the first three fingers of one hand under the most
laterally prominent transverse so as to hold it firm, first
placing the first finger carefully just behind and against the
end of that transverse and then reinforcing it with the
second and third fingers, slightly tensed, and resting their
tips on the lamina close underneath the occipital bone.</p>

<p>Next place the other hand so that the thumb rests
firmly upon the patient’s jaw and the first finger extends
backward along the lower margin of the occipital bone.</p>

<p>To complete the position rotate the head gently toward
the side of the laterally prominent Atlas, until it rests, face
toward the side, and is supported by the three fingers of the
one hand and the heel and wrist of the same hand. It will
be noted that when the head is rotated the first finger of
supporting hand slips to a position directly upon the tip of
the transverse process and the other two take its place
against the posterior aspect of the tip of the transverse. The
Atlas now rests with its intertransverse line almost vertically
upward from supporting fingers, which hold it against further
rotation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>When the neck muscles have been thoroughly relaxed by
slight and gentle movement, throw the upper elbow sharply
away from your body, which has the effect of transmitting
force through the thumb to the jaw and sharply rotating
the head still further, loosening its articulation with the now
firmly held Atlas. The condyloid joints thus loosened tend
to settle into their proper relations, the weight of the head
causing it to slip downward—laterally upon the Atlas.</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>This is really a movement of the head rather than of
the Atlas and is an easy movement when practicable. It
requires complete relaxation and will often fail. It is
probable that many apparent Atlas subluxations are really
subluxations of the head upon that bone which leave Atlas
and Axis in normal relation. This move is most used to
loosen the Atlas when it resists ordinary adjustments.</p>

<h3>“THE BREAK” No. 1<br />

<span class="subhead">(Lateral Cervical Move)</span></h3>

<p>The principle involved in this and the three succeeding
moves is the same. The contact is made with the end of the
laterally prominent transverse process of a Cervical vertebra
other than the Atlas, and the movement is directed entirely
from side to side. It is to be used only for lateral and not
for rotary or anterior or posterior subluxations, a point to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
be remembered as it is just as easy to produce as to correct
subluxation with this move.</p>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Have patient lying on back in position C, with head
projecting beyond bench and supported by adjuster’s knee.
Following a record previously made count downward to a
subluxated vertebra and palpate both transverses with the
two hands at once to find if one is prominent laterally, remembering
that the record indicates merely the position of
the spinous process.</p>

<p>Having found the laterally prominent transverse, place
the tip of the finger of the corresponding hand on the spinous
of the subluxated vertebra; that is, if a right subluxation,
use right hand and if a left, use left hand. Then draw the
hand around until the middle of the proximal phalanx of the
first finger rests against the end of the transverse. The tip
of the finger will be freed from the spinous by this movement.</p>

<p>Hold the adjusting hand tense, edgewise to the neck,
fingers together and pointing downward. The thumb may
rest against the patient’s jaw or may be free; the essential
thing is the snug contact of the first finger against the
transverse.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 10. “The Break,” No. 1, from right. Contact; first phalanx
with end of right transverse.</div></div>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>With the hand in position and the head supported by the
Hook Support, bend the head laterally, keeping the face upward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
until it is felt that further movement would strain
the muscles.</p>

<p>Deliver the movement in a straight lateral direction,
quickly and entirely with the contact hand.</p>

<h3>“THE BREAK” No. 2</h3>

<p>For the Atlas only, and for straight lateral displacement
of that vertebra.</p>

<h4>Position and Contact</h4>

<p>Position of patient’s head and of supporting hand exactly
as in using Break No. 1. Contact is made with the end
of the Atlas transverse on the laterally prominent side. Contact
point on hand is second metacarpo-phalangeal joint, or
rather, the condyle of the second metacarpal.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>As for Break No. 1.</p>

<h3>“THE BREAK” No. 3</h3>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Have patient sitting erect on bench or stool and stand
before him. For a right subluxation use left hand and for
a left, right hand. Contact point is the middle of the proximal
phalanx of the first finger and the fingers reach backward
and downward, thumb upward so as to be out of the
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Force <em>should</em> be applied entirely with the contact hand
to avoid the possibility that movement of the head may bring
about movement of some other vertebra than the desired one.
But in practice the force is usually divided between the head
and the vertebra. The Hook Support cannot be used in this
position.</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>The use of this position for the Break avoids the necessity
for the patient to lie down again in a new position after
having Dorsals and Lumbars adjusted. It is extremely
convenient. But on the other hand it is undeniably harder
for the patient to relax his muscles when sitting up with
head flexed sidewise and a sense of lost equilibrium than
when lying down. The Break No. 1 will be found the better
for the average case.</p>

<h3>“THE BREAK” No. 4</h3>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Same as Break No. 3 except that adjuster stands behind
patient and rests the thumb upon the base of the neck posteriorly
while the fingers extend downward and forward toward
the clavicle. As with No. 3, the supporting hand rests
against the opposite side of the head and forces it sidewise
to tighten the contact.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 11. “The Break,” No. 3.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Properly, a quick lateral movement of contact hand
while the head is firmly held by the opposing hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: “The Break” is unfortunately named and it
would be well if some less suggestive term were generally
substituted.</p>

<h3>THE ROTARY No. 1</h3>

<p>For the correction of rotation only, and usable in the
Cervicals from 2 to 7 inclusive.</p>

<h4>Philosophy of the Rotary</h4>

<p>A study of the Cervical articulations will make it clear
that if a force be applied laterally to the spinous process
the probable result will be a <em>rotation</em> of the vertebra, which
swings one articular process back from its fellow but leaves
the other in close, but modified, contact. Thus the spinous
process may appear to the left while the left articular process
is fitted firmly against that of the adjacent vertebra, while
those on the right are separated. Similar rotation, modified
only by the difference in shape of the vertebrae, occurs in the
Lumbar region.</p>

<p>A movement applied to the spinous process might correct
this condition or might complicate it according to the manner
of application. But the <em>most direct line</em> of force for correction
is along a line which would pierce the separated
articular processes almost in an antero-posterior direction.
The Rotary approaches this very closely. It is a setting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
forward of the articular process against its fellow by applying
a movement directly to the transverse process, which
lies very close to the articular process.</p>

<p>The great safety of the movement lies in the fact that it
is impossible with any reasonable amount of force to move
the transverse process too far. If the vertebra is not subluxated
so as to indicate this movement, gentle attempts to
use it will fail. The deceptive bent spinous process may
sometimes be detected in this way.</p>

<p>The chief objection to Rotary Nos. 1 and 2 is that the
Dorsals and Lumbars cannot be adjusted in this position
and the patient must rise from the bench and lie down again
to have his Cervicals adjusted. This is obviated if No. 3 is
used but the latter position fails to secure the perfect relaxation
of muscles of Nos. 1 and 2, and is therefore recommended
as an alternative only.</p>

<p>The commonest obstacle to the use of this move is the
voluntary or involuntary contraction of the neck muscles.
The Hook Support, q. v., will limit this resistance by affording
a sense of perfect security to the patient. If muscles are
<em>contractured</em> a slight “check” will be felt as the head reaches
a certain degree of rotation, and beyond this point it will
refuse to move though easily movable within the radius
limited by the “check.” It is as if the head were held by an
inelastic cord. It is best when contracture is present not
to attempt moving the head too far but to deliver the movement
with the muscles as much relaxed as possible.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 12. The Rotary, No. 1. Ready for the movement.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<h4>Position and Palpation</h4>

<p>Place patient in position C as described under Technic of
Palpation. Stand at head of bench with patient’s head supported
by one knee and perhaps also by one hand. Palpate
chiefly to discover the numbers of vertebrae, following a
record previously made. Finish palpation with the tip of
the first finger of either hand resting upon the spinous process
of the vertebra to be adjusted.</p>

<h4>Placing Contact</h4>

<p>Consider here which way the vertebra is to be moved; if
toward the right use right hand and if toward the left use
left hand for adjusting. Draw the adjusting hand straight
around until the first finger, about the middle of the proximal
phalanx, rests against and <em>behind</em> the transverse process.</p>

<p>It is important that the finger be drawn <em>straight</em> around,
and not upward or downward, except with the second Cervical
with which the finger may pass slightly upward to the
transverse. To insure correct placing of finger let patient’s
head be absolutely at rest, supported by the Hook Support
with face turned slightly away from the adjusting hand.
Reinforce contact finger with the other three fingers held
close together behind it. The thumb may or may not be
placed against patient’s jaw as desired, but one must be
careful not to lose exact contact by drawing adjusting hand
upward from a lower Cervical in an attempt to reach the
jaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<h4>Use of Second Hand</h4>

<p>Meanwhile the other hand supports the head and holds
its weight as described under the Hook Support, q. v.</p>

<h4>Turning Head</h4>

<p>Next, holding the first finger gently but firmly pressed
against the transverse process, turn the head in the direction
of the subluxation and away from the adjusting hand. That
is, if the vertebra be subluxated to the right turn the face
toward the right, the use of the terms “right” or “left”
referring to the spinous process.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>When the head is drawn around so that the vertebrae
are thoroughly separated on the side toward which movement
is to be directed, and the patient’s muscles are thoroughly
relaxed though it is felt that further rotation of the
head would put them upon a tension, give the movement. It
consists in a quick throw of the adjusting hand, force transmitted
from shoulder through an outward fling of the elbow,
directed upward and inward against the transverse process.
It replaces the articular process against its fellow, moving
one vertebra, smoothly and easily.</p>

<p><em>All</em> force should be delivered with contact hand. The
hand moves through very little space. The principle of the
movement is transmitted shock.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 13. The Rotary, No. 2.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<h3>THE ROTARY No. 2</h3>

<p>A transition in technic between No. 1 and No. 3.</p>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Patient lies face upward on closed table, head resting
upon forward section. Adjuster stands at side of patient,
choosing the side according to the subluxation so as to face
across the table in the direction toward which spinous process
is to move. Palpation is difficult in this position on
account of the increase in the curve of the Cervicals, so that
it is best to follow a record previously made.</p>

<p>Having found the subluxation make contact as follows.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Reach across patient’s neck with right hand for a right
subluxation or left hand for a left, and find spinous process.
Then draw the middle finger straight around until the palmar
surface of the middle finger just below the second joint
fits snugly behind the transverse process. Place the other
hand under the head and with both hands working together
turn the head toward you, chin upraised, and draw the neck
into a greater flexion until it is felt that contact is firm and
close.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>The movement is a quick drawing toward the adjuster
of the second, or contact, finger, which has been, as it were,
hooked over the transverse. The transverse is thus drawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
sharply forward and the vertebra rotates around its vertical
axis so that the spinous follows, or tends to follow, the transverse
in the same arc of movement.</p>

<h3>ROTARY No. 3</h3>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Patient sitting erect, both feet evenly on floor and hands
not braced. Stand in front of the patient but to one side or
the other as for Rotary No. 2. Use right hand for adjusting
right subluxations and left hand for lefts.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>As for No. 2, contact is with palmar surface of second
finger but may be shifted to third finger for the lower vertebrae
if desired. The thumb is usually placed on the mandible
and aids the opposite hand, placed on the other side of the
head, in turning and otherwise controlling the head.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Turn the head away from the adjusting hand until the
neck muscles feel taut as a result of position and not of
contraction. The movement then is given as a sharp jerk of
the contact hand forward.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 14. The Rotary, No. 3.</div></div>

<h3>ANCHOR MOVE No. 1</h3>

<h4>Theory</h4>

<p>It is held that a vertebra often loses its proper relation
with the vertebra below, and consequently with <em>all</em> the vertebrae,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
or the entire column of the spine below, without being
disturbed in its relation to the one, or ones, above; that, in
other words, the column may be divided into two sections
by subluxation, the upper section set askew upon the lower.
With this reasoning it would clearly be desirable to so adjust
the spine as to move a given vertebra, and with it all vertebra
above, so to speak, upon the vertebra below. To do
this all vertebrae above the one to which force is applied
must needs be firmly <em>anchored</em> to prevent strain between
them.</p>

<p>Such a move has been devised by Bunn for Cervical
use and is here described from the author’s few observations
only. Further study may modify the technic somewhat.</p>

<div id="ip_117" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="399" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 15. “Anchor Move,” No. 1. For a P. L. subluxation.</div></div>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Patient is placed as for Dorsal and Lumbar adjustments
in position B. Move is applied to rotated, postero-rotary,
and antero-rotary subluxations and face turned toward
side from which move is to be made. Adjuster, after
palpation which discovers the vertebra to be moved and the
direction of movement, stands at the head of table facing
patient’s feet.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>With the palms of both hands resting against the side of
the neck and thumbs extended at right angles to hands,
make contact with both thumbs on one vertebra as follows:</p>

<p>If vertebra is to be rotated toward patient’s left, place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
right thumb against spinous process on its left side and
left thumb upon right transverse process from behind it.
Press firmly with the palm and fingers of each hand against
the vertebrae above, gripping around neck and base of skull
so as to hold all parts together.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>The move is delivered simultaneously with the two
hands, forcing spinous process toward the right and transverse
in an anterior direction. The head must be raised
from the bench and wholly supported by the hands and the
head turns with the vertebra.</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>A powerful comparatively easy move which has the advantage
of wide applicability and of avoiding the change
of posture of the patient which mars many Cervical moves.</p>

  <img src="images/i_119.jpg" width="396" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 16. Posterior Cervical move.</div></div>

<h3>ANCHOR MOVE No. 2</h3>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Same as for No. 1.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>For a left subluxation to be moved toward the right,
place the left thumb upon the right side of the spinous
process so that it hooks over the spinous in position to draw
or pull the spinous. Place right thumb against the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the left transverse as much on the anterior side as possible
so that it may exert a <em>prying</em> force in a posterior direction.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Simultaneous application of force with the thumbs tends
to rotate the vertebra as does No. 1, but unlike No. 1 the
tendency is to bring the vertebra out in a posterior direction
instead of driving it more anteriorly.</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>This move is applied to rotated Cervicals which are
anterior, more on one side than on the other.</p>

<h3>POSTERIOR CERVICAL MOVE</h3>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>For a posterior Cervical below the Atlas. The common
and careless practice of moving such a vertebra with the
Rotary, or the dangerous practice of using the Recoil may
be avoided by this move and much better results obtained.</p>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Patient in position C, head projecting well beyond bench
so as to allow for a dropping backward of the head. Palpate
as for the Rotary and hold palpating finger on tip of
spinous process of posterior vertebra while contact is made.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Contact point is middle of radial surface of first phalanx
of first finger and is placed against the tip of the spinous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
process, directly between it and the floor, as the patient lies.
Hand is held rigid and edgewise, fingers together so that
the contact finger is well supported.</p>

<h4>Completing Position</h4>

<p>Use the free hand to hold the head with the Hook Support,
q. v. Turn the patient’s chin slightly away from the
adjusting hand and drop the elbow of adjusting arm down
until a straight line could pass through elbow, spinous process,
and patient’s chin. It may be well to crouch and rest
the elbow against one knee for solidity. Then allow the
head to drop backward until chin is elevated and further
backward flexion would strain the muscles. You are ready
for the movement.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>A quick throwing movement upward and inward, or toward
patient’s chin. As nearly as may be the force should
tend to pass along the spinous process in a direction exactly
anterior to the (then) plane of the vertebra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: Either hand may be used with this movement.</p>

<h3>DOUBLE CONTACT MOVE</h3>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>This is indicated for postero-rotary or postero-lateral
subluxations. Its line of force is a bisector of the angle between
the straight anterior and the straight lateral movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>There are two points of contact, both on the first finger,
one (first secured) on the radial side of the second phalanx
and the other on the radial side of the proximal phalanx.
The first contact point is placed against the tip of the
spinous, the other behind the transverse process.</p>

<p>Press slightly against the two processes with the finger so
as to feel them plainly.</p>

<h4>Completing Position</h4>

<p>Hold the head with the Hook Support and turn the face
away from the adjusting hand (right hand for a P. R., left
hand for a P. L.). Drop elbow low and hold it well away
from your body so that there appears an obtuse angle between
wrist and forearm with the point of the angle toward
you. Be careful of this point as the tendency is to make an
angle with the point away from you—a weak position.</p>

<p>Drop head backward until firm resistance is felt.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Force is delivered in an antero-lateral direction as above
described, <em>entirely</em> with adjusting hand.</p>

<h3>THE “T. M.” No. 1</h3>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>For subluxations listed R or L but not Posterior and
upon C 6, C 7, D 1, and D 2 only. This movement applies
a lateral force to the spinous process so as to correct <em>rotation</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
of the vertebra, but I repeat that it is inappropriate for
posterior or postero-lateral subluxations.</p>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Patient lying in position B as for Dorsal adjustment.
Find the subluxation by following the record and perceiving
that the count assumed to be correct permits the subluxations
to correspond to those recorded and that a vertebra in this
region is R or L, R. A. or L. A., R. S. or L. S., R. I. or L. I.
The laterality of the spinous process determines the next
step.</p>

<p>For a right subluxation turn the face toward the <em>left</em>
and use <em>right</em> hand for contact hand. For a left subluxation
turn the face to the right and use left hand for contact hand.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Thumb of contact hand is placed upon and against the
side of the spinous process so that it presses firmly. The
thumb is extended almost at right angles to the hand which
rests upon the patient’s shoulder with fingers extending, and
gripping, over the clavicle. Be sure of the solidity of the
position.</p>

<p>Next place the other hand upon the patient’s forehead
and press the head backward, or toward the side of the contact
hand, until the neck is well flexed and the tissues tightened
between the now opposing hands.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 19. The “T. M.,” No. 1.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>When this tightened condition is reached a quick decisive
movement of <em>both</em> hands in opposite directions, but chiefly
of the hand applied to the head, will secure an easy movement
of the vertebra.</p>

<p>This move is a very valuable adaptation of the old crude
and other dangerous “T. M.,” of which No. 2, below, is
another, more like the original move but possessing several
“safety” features.</p>

<h3>“T. M.” No. 2</h3>

<h4>Position of Patient</h4>

<p>The patient sits erect on a flat seat with both feet resting
upon the floor as during palpation.</p>

<h4>Placing Hands</h4>

<p>After careful palpation and selection of a vertebra to be
adjusted in this way, stand directly behind the patient. If
the vertebra is subluxated to the right use right hand for
adjusting (or contact) hand, if to the left use left hand.
Hold the hand so that the thumb is at right angles to the
hand and tense and firm. Place the palmar surface of the
end of the thumb against and upon the tip of the spinous
process and grasp the neck firmly with the fingers, which
extend over the base of the neck and toward the clavicle.
The other hand is placed easily on the top of the head.</p>

<h4>Position of Head</h4>

<p>The completing of position after contact has been made
is governed by two considerations; the need for relaxing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
neck muscles and for so supporting the vertebrae above
the contact that movement will take place only at the point
of contact. If the neck muscles are contracted the movement
is almost always defeated and should always be abandoned
to avoid strain.</p>

<p>To secure the desired position ask the patient to relax his
muscles and allow you to place his head as desired. If he
seeks to place it himself the necessary muscular contraction
on his part will defeat the movement. The movements of
the head must be passive.</p>

<p>With thumb and remainder of adjusting hand properly
placed, use the other hand upon the head as follows: First
flex the head forward on the chest as far as possible, then
rotate it slightly so that the face is turned a little toward
adjusting hand. Then flex the head sidewise until a resisting
pull of muscles indicates that they have been stretched
taut. It is well during the third movement described to let
the forearm swing down at right angles to the hand so that
it presses firmly against the ends of all the Cervical transverses,
distributing the force among them.</p>

<p>Or, after placing contact hand rest the elbow in the
angle at the base of the neck and let the forearm extend upward
along the side of the neck. Then flex the wrist until
the hand will rest upon the patient’s head and perform the
movements of the head as described above.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 20. The “T. M.,” No. 2. Note position of right arm and
hand of adjuster.</div></div>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>A quick, simultaneous movement of both hands in opposite
directions, <em>two-thirds</em> of which is given with the hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
which holds the head. The thumb in contact with the spinous
process moves slightly inward toward the median line but
its chief use is to hold the vertebra very firmly. To this
end part of its force is directed forward against the shoulder
and through the ball of the thumb.</p>

<p>Failure to place the head properly or in securing sufficient
flexion of the neck before move is attempted are the
chief causes of failure. Force must be delivered quickly
and sharply and the best adjustment of this kind is usually
the one in which the head and hands move through the least
space.</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>This movement is obviously useful only for the correction
of <em>rotation</em>, since the force is directed sidewise against the
spinous process.</p>

<p>The “T. M.” was originally intended as a Cervical adjustment,
but its greatest use is now from C 6 to D 2 inclusive.
Above the sixth its use is questionable because of the
possibility of moving more than one vertebra or some other
than the one desired.</p>

<h3>“THE RECOIL”<br />

<span class="subhead">(Pisiform Contact)</span></h3>

<h4>Position of Patient</h4>

<p>This movement is best given on bifid bench of the type
commonly known to the profession. Place patient on forward
section so that its rear edge rests just below the axilla;
this may be ascertained by passing a hand under patient’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
arm after he is in position, when the edge of the bench
should be felt about an inch below the hanging arm. The
thighs should rest on rear section so that the pubic symphysis
is free of the bench. The semicircular pubic cut is
an advantage in that it avoids injury without making necessary
too great a suspension between sections.</p>

<p>Thus the abdomen and the lower part of the thorax are
suspended between sections. Under them an abdominal
support may be used but it must have the quality of elasticity
in a high degree and must lie always below the plane of the
other two sections or it will interfere with a perfect adjustment.</p>

<p>For adjustment of the last two Cervicals or any Dorsal
down to the sixth, it is best to turn patient’s head toward
the direction of the subluxation. This curves that section
of the spine into an arc toward the convex side of which
movement may be made more easily than toward the concave.</p>

<p>The patient’s hands may lie under the table, loosely, or
may reach back and rest upon the buttocks, palm upward.
Whichever position secures best relaxation is to be used in
any case.</p>

<p>This movement may be used with the roll. (See <a href="#ip_152">Fig. 30</a>
and <a href="#Page_285">p. 285</a>.)</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 21. After palpation. Finger ready to guide contact hand
to a spinous process.</div></div>

<h4>Position of Adjuster</h4>

<p>Stand on either side of patient, feet apart for base and
poise. The direction of the feet and position of body will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
vary according to the direction of the adjustment, by the
following two rules:</p>

<p>Rule 1. For movement of a vertebra <em>away</em> from the side
on which you stand, place your arms and hands in such a
position that the pisiform bone of adjusting hand, both elbows,
and both shoulder joints (shoulders being dropped
loosely forward) will fall in the same plane and that the
plane of direction in which the vertebra is to be moved. In
other words, let the force be applied in a line straight from
your body <em>through</em> the vertebra. Always shift your feet to
a proper position from which to direct the movement.</p>

<p>Rule 2. To move a vertebra <em>toward</em> the side on which
you stand, step close to patient’s body and support yourself
with one knee against the adjusting table at the most convenient
point. Then place arms so that contact point, elbows,
shoulders, and the mid-point of the body’s base, between
the feet, are all in the same plane. This insures balance during
and after the movement and is the attitude from which
the greatest and most carefully measured force can be delivered.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the desire is always to deliver all
force in one plane and thus avoid conflict of forces and
waste or misdirection through the predominance of one
force over the other, and to use both arms with equal facility
in the move. There are at least a hundred ways to hinder
this movement by varying the preliminary positions. And
no one can know the real efficiency of the move who has not
become instinctively adept at taking position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h4>Use of Hands and Arms</h4>

<p>Use of hands for palpation has been described. (<a href="#Page_46">P. 46</a>.)</p>

<p>The palpating hand comes to rest with the middle finger
on the spinous process of the vertebra to be adjusted. The
heel of the hand is raised, the first and third fingers doubled
back, and the heel lowered again. Now the middle finger
alone is a slender pointer guiding to the contact point.</p>

<p>Place pisiform bone of other hand snugly <em>against</em> the
process to be moved. The hand should rest in a slight arch,
pisiform against spinous, fingers rigid and flexed on hand,
last finger firmly anchored, or pressed into the flesh, to
prevent slipping. (Fig. 22 shows the position.)</p>

<p>The anchoring fingers must always extend away from the
adjuster. To turn the fingers back across the spine, in moving
a vertebra toward you, is always an error, and the price
is partial loss of use of one arm.</p>

<p>With the adjusting hand satisfactorily placed, grasp its
wrist firmly with the other hand so that the pisiform of the
supporting hand rests in the hollow between the wrist and
the metacarpal bone of the extended thumb. By this contact
force is driven directly through the chain of bones
across the wrist and to the pisiform bone without spreading.
In grasping the wrist let the thumb extend around the forearm
in one direction and the four fingers in the other. Beware
of gripping only with thumb and first finger in which
case the edge of the supporting hand will rest on the back
of the contact hand and spread the delivered force too
widely.</p>

<div id="ip_128" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="600" height="345" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 22. “The Recoil.” Ready for the movement.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>I have said, but have not sufficiently emphasized the
command, that the shoulders must be dropped loosely forward.
Let me add that just before the movement is given
the head should be allowed to sag downward and the muscles
to become relaxed. This movement given with stiff
shoulders and upraised head becomes a <em>push</em>.</p>

<p>The desired movement is a <em>throwing</em> movement.</p>

<p>Force is released from both shoulders at once, concentrated
at the same instant by a slight shifting forward of
the elbows, and strikes the spinous process as <em>one</em> force,
which is the resultant of the two meeting at the wrist of
contact hand and being united there. The two arms use the
contact hand as a passive instrument for driving the vertebra.</p>

<p>The objective point, the distance to which the movement
is mentally thrown at the instant of delivery, should be the
center of mass of the vertebra, varying according to the
section of the spine.</p>

<h4>Contact Point</h4>

<p>The exact contact point of hand with vertebra varies. If
the vertebra is to be moved toward the right the pisiform
rests <em>against</em> (not <em>upon</em>) the left side of the spinous; if toward
the left and inferior, against the right side and just
above, in the notch between it and the next superior process.
The rule is to so place hand that the spinous process is between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the pisiform and the direction to which movement is
given.</p>

<p>On the hand the contact may be said to vary, according
to the direction of subluxation and position of adjuster, so
as to describe a circle around the pisiform in the course of
the various changes of position necessary to the use of this
movement. No error could be greater than to attempt to
use always the same face of the pisiform and to adapt the
position of hands and arms to this end, when any face or
aspect of the little bone is equally good with any other.</p>

<h4>Which Hand Used</h4>

<p>When standing on patient’s right use left hand for palpating
hand and right hand for contact with the vertebra,
using left hand again to grip and reinforce the contact hand.
Exception to this is made by introducing an extra change of
hands with C 6, or 7, D 1, L 4 or 5, and Sacrum. The
change is necessitated by the insecurity of the usual position
or the fact that it cramps the wrist of contact hand. To
make the change: palpate as usual, hold subluxation with
second finger of palpating hand, substitute second finger of
other hand and withdraw palpating hand, which is then
free to make the contact.</p>

<p>When standing on left side exactly reverse the use of
hands. Palpate with the same hand which would be used if
patient were sitting. Introduce no unnecessary move into
the placing of the hands. This will be found to produce
better results than any other technic for this portion of the
move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<h4>Delivery of Force</h4>

<p>In using this movement it is perhaps best to deliver
nearly equal force with both hands; certainly whatever
forces are released by the arms should be simultaneous. It
is possible, however, to allow one arm to preponderate in
the movement without marring its efficiency, but the amateur
adjuster will do well to balance his forces at first.</p>

<h4>Speed and Concentration</h4>

<p>Speed is a prime essential. By its employment a very
ordinary amount of muscular strength can be made to accomplish
a large amount of work and very difficult adjustments
may be accomplished.</p>

<p>Concentration of mind at the instant of adjustment, so
as to secure muscular control and perfect co-ordination of
the two arms as well as to direct and concentrate the forces
used at a given and strictly limited area, is also essential.</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>For ordinary adjustments of Dorsal or Lumbar subluxations,
excepting the middle four Dorsals, for breaking
ankyloses by repeated applications of force, and for overcoming
muscular resistance in patients who are unable to
relax at all, this form or style of adjusting is probably the
best. It is most useful in the Dorsals. In many instances
Lumbar vertebrae will move better by application of a
slightly slower force, especially if a roll is used. The Recoil
may be used with the roll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>While it is easily possible to move any Cervical in this
way, making no change in the technic except to use the ulnar
side of the fifth metacarpal bone for the contact instead of
the pisiform, it is inadvisable in most cases above the sixth,
and in some instances absolutely unpardonable. The shock
to the nervous system and the danger of moving two or
more vertebrae or of subluxating a normal one are too great.
In at least one instance hemiplegia instantly followed the
use of this move on the Axis, and headaches and nerve
exhaustion are frequent sequelae.</p>

<p>For these reasons it is probably best never to use “The
Recoil” above the sixth Cervical. For every form of subluxation
there is an easier and safer mode of correction.</p>

<h4>Name</h4>

<p>This has been called “The Recoil” because of a belief
that if force be applied to a vertebra in the form of a very
rapidly transmitted shock the vertebra will rebound to the
shock and settle in its normal position, the intelligence within
the body utilizing the force thus blindly applied to bring
about this result.</p>

<p>This belief is erroneous. First the vertebra and all surrounding
tissues are misshapen to fit their <em>abnormal</em> position
and relation and this shape gives them a tendency, if rapidly
loosened, to settle into the old abnormal position. Second,
there is no such conscious intelligence which has power to
replace a subluxated vertebra. If this supposition were
correct, then the Innate Intelligence would do well to utilize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
those jars and shocks which ordinarily <em>produce</em> subluxation
to bring about normality and keep the spine perfectly
aligned.</p>

<p>There is no such internal rebound or recoil as stated
above. The chief value of the movement lies in its speed,
according to principles equally applicable to other moves,
and in accord with the Law of Momentum.</p>

<h4>Sources of Information</h4>

<p>This movement as described above contains many essential
principles which follow Parker and Palmer, developers
of “The Recoil,” but the technic is considerably
modified to suit the author’s own views. It cannot be claimed,
therefore, that this is “The Recoil” as now taught by Palmer,
since the chief stress is here laid upon the movement
of the vertebra in a predetermined direction and not upon
the withdrawal of the hands to let “Innate” do the work.
The name “Recoil” is really inappropriate for the move as
described.</p>

<h3>THE HEEL CONTACT</h3>

<p>A movement for the adjustment of posterior, postero-superior,
or postero-inferior subluxations in the Dorsal
region (except middle four) and in the Lumbar. May also
be used for postero-laterals when laterality is very slight.
Given with patient in position B. Contact point, heel of hand
with spinous process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<h4>Heel Contact</h4>

<p>By the “heel of the hand” is here meant the depression
between the scaphoid and pisiform bones. This hollow
forms a natural receiver for a spinous process and thus
avoids lateral slipping.</p>

<p>The four fingers of adjusting hand are spread out and
anchored upon the patient’s body. The wrist is held at a
right angle to hand and the arm straightened, the elbow
being outrotated until it “locks,” that is until it will move no
farther. The other hand grasps the wrist of the adjusting
hand.</p>

<h4>Adjusting Hand</h4>

<p>The rule is to use the right hand for adjusting hand if
standing on patient’s right and palpating with left, or to
use left hand if on left side and palpating with right. The
fingers are to be directed toward the patient’s feet. Exception
to this rule is made with the last two Lumbars, where
it is more convenient to change hands and direct the fingers
toward the head.</p>

<div id="ip_134" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_134.jpg" width="399" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 23. “Heel contact.”</div></div>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>This is given almost entirely with adjusting arm; that
is, with the arm whose hand is in contact with the vertebra.
The supporting hand serves merely to guide the force to a
definite point as if a straight rod were working through a
fixed circlet. Indeed, the force in this movement is delivered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
almost straight down from the shoulder. Shoulder
should be dropped well out of its socket so as to secure
play for a sudden downward movement without raising the
hand from its contact. If the shoulder is stiff or the head
of the humerus remains in the glenoid cavity the movement
cannot be properly given without raising the hand. Movement
is quick, sharp, and <em>deep</em>, i. e., directed to the center of
mass of the vertebra.</p>

<p>It may be directed straight toward floor to correct a
posterior, inclined slightly toward the head or feet to correct
approximation, or—as some aver—slightly sidewise to
correct a mild degree of rotation.</p>

<h3>PISIFORM DOUBLE TRANSVERSE No. 1</h3>

<p>An adjustment to be used only in the Dorsals from
fourth to ninth inclusive, for posterior or postero-rotary subluxations.
It is probably best to use this movement only for
straight posterior subluxations and to apply either the Pisiform
Single Transverse or the Two Finger Double Transverse
to the rotary displacements in this region.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Both pisiform bones, each <em>upon</em> a transverse process
and both upon the <em>same</em> vertebra.</p>

<p>With patient in position B and the adjuster standing
upon his left the contact should be made by the following
exact method. Palpate with right hand, which comes to
rest upon the spinous process of the subluxated vertebra.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Note if it be P. R. or P. L., because this fact will govern
the next movement. Let the first finger of palpating hand
reach outward about one inch and upward to a point opposite
the tip of the next superior spinous process, which point
will approximate the position of the transverse. This
first upon the side of the <em>posterior</em> transverse, which will be
the right with a left subluxation or the left with a right
one. Let second and third fingers, now abandoning the
spinous, follow the first and rest over the assumed position
of the transverse.</p>

<p>Now palpate with a deep, limited, massage movement
until the club-shaped extremity of the transverse is felt
under the middle finger. Hold this point with the middle
finger, drawing away the other two, and guide the free hand
to an exact contact <em>upon</em> the transverse. Thus if standing
on the left, as predicated, the <em>left</em> hand will be first to make
contact and with the most posterior transverse, with which
most <em>exact</em> contact is necessary.</p>

<p>With pisiform placed, let the fingers extend away from
your body; if on the side of the spine opposite you, let them
extend downward so as to follow the curve of the rib and to
be anchored upon the rib connected with the transverse of
contact; if on the same side, let fingers extend downward
parallel with the column.</p>

<div id="ip_136" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_136.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 24. Pisiform double transverse adjustment as it should be
given, elbows locked.</div></div>

<p>Now—still using the original palpating hand—palpate
on the other side from the first contact until the other transverse
is discovered. Mark its tip with a quick, deep pressure
and a sharp withdrawal of the fingers, so that a spot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
of anaemia appears momentarily. Carefully place the pisiform
of the palpating hand in contact, guided by the anaemic
spot. If this second contact is on the side on which you
stand the fingers will be toward the head; if on the opposite
side, they will follow the rib curve outward and downward.</p>

<p>Re-read the above directions carefully. It will be seen
that the technic is quite free from unnecessary movements.</p>

<p>The two hands are now placed almost exactly at right
angles to each other, arched fingers anchored to prevent
slipping.</p>

<p>If you stand on the patient’s right the use of hands is, of
course, exactly reversed, the left hand being palpating hand,
and making the first contact.</p>

<h4>Completing Position</h4>

<p>When hands are in position and adjuster standing so as
to face directly across the spine, the arms are rotated outward
until the elbows “lock.” The adjuster leans over so
as to have shoulders directly over the spine, draws the body
back from the shoulder girdle to secure freest play in the
shoulder joints, and drops head loosely between the shoulders
so as to relax the trapezius and prevent any checking of the
force.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Directly downward from the shoulders through straight,
stiff arms. The force is delivered separately with the two
arms and yet simultaneously. If the vertebra is straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
posterior, equal force must be applied on the two sides; if
it is posterior and slightly rotated (P. R. or P. L.), most
force must be applied to the more posterior transverse.</p>

<p>Considerable practice and looseness of shoulder are required
to use this movement properly. It is a regrettable
fact that few adjusters <em>do</em> use it correctly, most of them
giving a <em>thrust</em> instead of a transmitted shock.</p>

<h3>PISIFORM DOUBLE TRANSVERSE No. 2</h3>

<p>This modification of the pisiform double transverse move
is here described because of its popularity rather than because
the author wishes to recommend it. The position is
the same as for No. 1, and the uses also, except that it tends
to correct postero-inferior subluxations and is not at all
adapted for use with superiors.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Both pisiforms below the two transverses (caudad).
After palpation which discloses the posterior transverse the
hands are placed as follows: Palpating hand rests always
on the side of the spine next the operator; opposite hand
crosses the spine. Both are slanted upward so that the
fingers point toward the head with the axes of the hand
slightly diverging above. The wrists are thus crossed in
such a way as to force the forearms to be somewhat flexed
on the arms and to slant away from the wrists at an obtuse
angle. This with the contact <em>below</em> the transverses, renders
it impossible not to force the vertebra in an upward (superior)
direction when movement is given.</p>

<div id="ip_138" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.625em;">
  <img src="images/i_139.jpg" width="394" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 25. Two-finger double transverse.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>A comparatively slow thrusting movement, which tends
to spring the spine. The merit of this method lies in its
comparative painlessness. Its technic is not attractive.</p>

<h3>TWO FINGER DOUBLE TRANSVERSE</h3>

<p>A movement for posterior or postero-rotary displacements
from fourth to ninth Dorsal inclusive. It serves the
same purpose as the Pisiform Double Transverse but is less
painful and often easier of delivery. The palmar surface of
the fingers, with the flesh of the patient’s back, make a compound
cushion which acts as a shock-absorber.</p>

<h4>Palpation—Contact</h4>

<p>The usual downward gliding movement of left hand if
standing on right or of right hand if standing on left will
serve for the discovery of the vertebra listed for adjustment.
The gliding hand stops with the second finger indicating the
spinous process. The first finger reaches upward and outward
to the assumed location of the transverse on the side
nearest the adjuster; then the second finger reaches to a
similar point on the other side, both fingers pointing toward
patient’s head. Now the fingers are rolled a little to make
sure that they are in contact with the ends of the transverse,
the palmar surface of the tip of each finger being the proper
contact point. The heel of the contact hand rests near, but
not on, the surface of the body over the midspinal line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<h4>Supporting Hand</h4>

<p>The ulnar edge of the free hand is now placed across
the tips of the two contact fingers so that it rests directly
above the ends of the transverses but separated from them
by the finger tips. The upper arm is then straightened and
the elbow outrotated until it locks firmly so that the arm
makes a straight line directly above the transverses. The
body is drawn away from the shoulder girdle, pulling the
head of the humerus out of its socket as far as possible to
allow free play, for all force is to be given by this straight
arm.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>If the subluxation is a straight posterior the force is
driven directly downward so as to be distributed equally to
the two contact points. If it be a postero-rotary, most force
is directed to the more prominent (posterior) transverse.
Force should be delivered quickly, keeping in mind the principle
of transmitted shock.</p>

<p>Contrary to the general belief, as much force can be
developed with this move as is needful for any ordinary
adjustment. The fact that it is often recommended for use
with children or with sensitive or frail patients has led to
the belief that it is a relatively ineffective move, whereas its
value in such cases lies only in the fact that it inflicts less
pain than some others.</p>

<div id="ip_140" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 26. Pisiform single transverse move, No. 1.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<h3>PISIFORM SINGLE TRANSVERSE MOVE No. 1</h3>

<p>Like the movement just described, this adjustment may
be used in the Dorsals from fourth to ninth inclusive. It
should be limited to those subluxations which are rotated
without being posterior. In such an instance the spinous
process <em>appears</em> to be laterally displaced without being posterior,
or may appear slightly <em>anterior</em> because it is describing
an arc about a fixed center of rotation in the body
of the vertebra. One transverse process appears anterior
and the other posterior to the line of their fellows.</p>

<h4>Palpation</h4>

<p>Palpate as for the Recoil and use the same adjusting
hand as in that movement, i. e., right hand if standing on
right side and palpating with left, or left hand if standing
on left and palpating with right. When the palpating fingers
have discovered the subluxated spinous process, the first
finger seeks a point even with the tip of the next superior
spinous process and about an inch to the side on which is
the <em>posterior</em> (prominent) transverse. The second and
third fingers follow and, dipping inward with a rolling or
massage motion, discover the end of the transverse.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Now the adjusting hand is placed with its pisiform resting
directly <em>upon</em> the blunt end of the transverse. If the
contact is on the same side of the spine with the adjuster
the fingers of adjusting hand extend across the spine and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
are anchored on the other side, the hand arching sharply
and fingers extending somewhat downward. If contact is
on opposite side of spine the fingers follow the rib curve
downward and outward and are similarly anchored. In
every case the fingers should extend away from, and never
toward, the adjuster’s body. To violate this rule renders
one arm almost useless through its position.</p>

<p>At this juncture the palpating hand becomes a reinforcing
hand, to grip the wrist of the other and to aid in the movement.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>The force is directed in a straight anterior direction,
quickly and decisively, as if a spinous process were the
lever used. Remember that contact must always be made
with the <em>posterior</em> transverse. To drive this anterior is to
rotate the vertebra around its vertical axis and to bring the
spinous process toward the median line, while the opposite,
and more anterior, transverse becomes more posterior, as it
should be.</p>

<h3>PISIFORM SINGLE TRANSVERSE No. 2</h3>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>For rotated first or second Dorsals with which, for any
reason, the “T. M.” fails. This move involves a use of the
head as a lever, as does the “T. M.” No. 2. Inadvisable unless
the posterior transverse of the rotated vertebra can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
palpated—but often used in cheerful disregard of this detail
by those sublimely capable adjusters who do not need to
find a vertebra before moving it.</p>

<h4>Palpation—Contact</h4>

<p>Palpate as for No. 1 above. Very deep palpation will
be necessary because the spinous process here is nearly
horizontal to the body and the transverse is very deeply
placed, overlaid with heavy muscles.</p>

<p>When process is found place pisiform bone of free hand
upon it, pressing the muscles aside as much as possible to
avoid bruising and resting a considerable amount of weight
upon the contact hand. Fingers of contact hand may extend
across the spine or downward and parallel with the
spine. Or, the hands may be changed so that the palpating
hand becomes the contact hand and is placed with the fingers
gripped over the base of the neck toward the clavicle.</p>

<h4>Head Leverage</h4>

<p>The free hand is now placed upon the forehead and the
head, which faces toward the contact hand, is flexed backward
until the muscles seem taut.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Is a quick, but fairly gentle, movement of both hands
together, so that the head is rocked still further backward
at the instant an anteriorly directed force is applied to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
prominent transverse. The result is rotation of the vertebra—unless
there be a loose articulation in the Cervicals which
gives way under the force applied to the head.</p>

<h3>THE EDGE CONTACT<br />

<span class="subhead">(“Point 2 Contact”—“Knife Move.”)</span></h3>

<h4>Name</h4>

<p>This movement has various names. The name “Point
2 Contact” is handed down from the days when Palmer
used three contact points and three moves and designated
the middle of the ulnar side of the fifth metacarpal bone as
“Point 2.” The name “Edge Contact” was applied later,
during the improvements in its technic when the hooking
of the thumbs stiffened its efficiency and made it very valuable.
It has since been rediscovered (though in constant
use) and re-named “Knife Move.”</p>

<h4>Uses</h4>

<p>A movement which uses the spinous process as a lever
and is applicable to D 2, 3, or 4, and to any Dorsal or Lumbar
from D 8 down, when posterior, postero-superior, or postero-inferior.
It does not correct rotation except insofar as the
shape of articular processes may aid an anteriorly directed
move in rotating the vertebra.</p>

<p>Some Chiropractors have used the Edge Contact in the
Cervicals but this is always improper, as it is practically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
impossible in some, and difficult in all, cases to cover only one
spinous process when the head is resting on its side.</p>

<div id="ip_145" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_145.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 27. The edge contact in Lumbar region.</div></div>

<h4>Palpation</h4>

<p>Same as for Recoil or Heel Contact, q. v.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Using the same adjusting hand as for the Heel Contact,
place the middle of the ulnar edge of the fifth metacarpal
bone in contact with the spinous process. If the vertebra
be superior, place the edge of hand <em>above</em>, if inferior, place
the hand <em>below</em>. This contact is especially good for S or I
vertebrae.</p>

<h4>Position of Hands and Arms</h4>

<p>The fingers of adjusting hand cross the spine at a right
angle to its long axis. The back of hand will be toward
patient’s head except in adjusting the last two Lumbars,
with which a change of hands is made necessary by the
upward slant of the lower half of the Lumbar curve.</p>

<p>The palpating hand now grips the adjusting hand so
that the fingers of the upper hand, held close together, press
against and reinforce the lower on its dorsum and just
above the contact point. The thumbs are hooked together
as shown in Fig. 27, so that the hands may be stiffened and
their tendency to roll avoided.</p>

<p>The elbows are outrotated and locked as in the Pisiform
Double Transverse Move and both shoulders are
loosened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>This is chiefly delivered with the upper arm, using upper
hand to drive the lower. Force should be quickly delivered
when patient is relaxed. The direction of force should be
determined by the direction of subluxation and by the slant
of the spinous process. Thus, when patient lies prone upon
a bifid bench and sways downward against a lax abdominal
support, the spinous processes of the lower dorsal make an
acute angle with the plane of the floor. If one be superior,
contact above it and force driven straight toward the floor
will tend to correct the subluxation. There is a slightly
different force angle for every subluxation correctable by
this move.</p>

<p>This move is less painful than the pisiform contact and
may often be used to advantage, especially in the Lumbar
region.</p>

<h3>LUMBAR SINGLE TRANSVERSE</h3>

<p>For the correction of a rotated Lumbar. Best used on
second and third. This movement should never be attempted
unless the transverse process can be palpated. Lumbar
transverses are sometimes short or fragile, and unless they
can be distinctly felt no force should be applied where they
are <em>believed</em> to lie.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Pisiform bone with posterior transverse.</p>

<div id="ip_146" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_147.jpg" width="396" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 28. Lumbar single transverse move.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<h4>Palpation and Placing of Hands</h4>

<p>Palpating as if for other movements, pause with the
second finger of palpating hand indicating the spinous process
of the vertebra to be moved. Note that if the spinous
process be to the right of the median line the left transverse
will be posterior, if to the left, the right transverse.</p>

<p>The transverse may then be found as in the Dorsals; it
should lie even with the interspace above the spinous process,
deeply overlaid with strong muscles. When the transverse
has been located by a deep, probing movement of the
fingers, place adjusting hand, pisiform on transverse, close
to the spinous process for greater solidity and fingers extending
downward and outward from the midspinal line
parallel with the lower rib curve.</p>

<p>If the adjuster stands on the side of the patient opposite
to the transverse to be moved the hand opposite the palpating
hand becomes the contact hand, as in other moves. But if
the posterior transverse is on the same side with the adjuster,
a change of hands is made and the palpating hand becomes
contact hand. To accomplish this the adjuster must turn
and face away from the patient with arm extended straight
downward to the contact. After contact is made the remaining
hand reinforces the adjusting hand by gripping the
wrist.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>In making the contact press downward, deeply and
firmly, so as to crowd the muscles aside and place the pisiform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
directly <em>upon</em> the transverse. Movement is given after
the patient’s body has been swung downward for a considerable
distance, and is sharp and decisive, directed
straight toward the floor.</p>

<h3>LUMBAR DOUBLE TRANSVERSE MOVE</h3>

<p>A movement sometimes applied to posterior or postero-rotary
Lumbars.</p>

<h4>Palpation and Contact</h4>

<p>From the spinous, find first the more posterior transverse
and make contact with it, since most force must be directed
there. Stand facing patient’s head and place right hand on
right transverse and left hand on left.</p>

<p>Contact point in this move is the tuberosity of the
scaphoid with the posterior surface of the transverse. Fingers
curve away from median line so as to avoid the rib curve.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>After heavy, steady pressure downward, force is delivered
with a quick, throwing movement, most force on
the posterior side.</p>

<h3>THE “SPREAD” MOVE</h3>

<p>Upon the theory that when two forces are simultaneously
applied, the one to drive some vertebra cephalad (by its
spinous process) and the other to drive some lower vertebra
caudad, the intervening vertebrae tend, if anterior, to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
drawn outward or toward a more posterior position, this
move is predicated.</p>

<p>The author does not believe that it accomplishes its
purpose, but will briefly describe it for the benefit of those
who do.</p>

<h4>Position</h4>

<p>Patient is placed over a roll which rests under the thighs
so as to flex thighs and pelvis on the Lumbar spine, or an
adjustable table is so tilted, both sections sloping downward
from the middle, as to accomplish the same result.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>The usual method, if only a single vertebra is anterior,
is to make contact with the vertebrae immediately adjacent,
crossing the hands and having fingers of upper hand pointing
toward head and of lower hand toward Sacrum. But
some adjusters use this move differently, making contact
with Sacrum and with the mid-dorsal region in general
and applying a slow force with both hands. Contact is with
heel of hand upon spinous process.</p>

<h3>SACRAL ADJUSTMENTS</h3>

<p>The adjustment of the comparatively fixed sacrum is
difficult at best and requires a very considerable force, violently
applied. It is probable that nine-tenths of all attempts
to move sacra fail. In children, when sacrum does
not articulate properly with the ilia, and in adults in whom
the sacrum has been loosened by trauma and remains in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
an abnormal relation to surrounding structures, it can be
moved.</p>

<p>The sacrum is described as being posterior at the base
or at the apex, and its axis for rotation is believed to be a
transverse line through the sacroiliac articulations. Force
for its adjustment is applied at right angles to the curve of
the sacrum at the point of contact. The best contact is with
the heel of the hand against a part of the sacrum, the wrist
of the adjusting hand being gripped and reinforced by the
other hand. If standing on patient’s left, the right hand
becomes adjusting hand for sacrum as for the last two Lumbars,
if on the right, the left hand.</p>

<p>Another contact is with the pisiform and adjacent soft
part of hand upon the sacral base, the pisiform hooking
against the first sacral spinous process.</p>

<p>Do not mistake an anterior fifth Lumbar for a posterior
sacral base. Discriminate between iliac and sacral subluxations
by noting that with the latter both sacroiliac articulations,
and with the former only one seems abnormal.</p>

<div id="ip_150" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.125em;">
  <img src="images/i_150.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 29. “Bohemian Move” for correction of anterior fifth Lumbar
by transmitting shock through spine.</div></div>

<h3>ILIAC ADJUSTMENTS</h3>

<h4>Palpation</h4>

<p>With patient sitting erect on flat surface, feet on floor,
stand behind and examine both sacroiliac articulations at
once with the palmar surfaces of the fingers of both hands.
If the two articulations are similar in every line neither
ilium is subluxated, though the <em>sacrum</em> may be rotated on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
its transverse axis between the ilia, so as to be posterior or
anterior at base or apex.</p>

<p>But no examination of the ilia is complete without investigating
also the lumbosacral articulation. It sometimes
happens that though the first sacral spinous process naturally
completes the lumbar curve and there is no lumbosacral
subluxation the crests of both ilia appear much posterior to
their normal relation to the upper part of sacrum: this is
a double iliac displacement.</p>

<p>Usually the ilia are both normally articulated; this is
one of the most difficult joints to weaken and is seldom
affected except by the most extreme force. When iliac
subluxation exists one side is affected alone nine times out
of ten. The tenth case may show double subluxation.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Nine-tenths of the so-called “iliac adjustments” are
quite amusingly ineffective. The force required really to <em>move</em>
an ileum (save in joint disease or in children) is tremendous
and not to be commanded by the ordinary adjuster. The
light jars applied as a routine procedure by so many Chiropractors
are in reality nothing more than single percussion
strokes which stimulate the sacral nerves.</p>

<p>Place patient in position B and apply the hands to a
posterior ilium as to a posterior sacrum, making contact
with the most prominent portion of crest or posterior border
and driving in a direction which would represent a part of
the circumference of a circle of which the transverse sacral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
axis of rotation touches the center, or the center of fixation
in the sacroiliac joint.</p>

<h3>COCCYGEAL ADJUSTMENTS</h3>

<h4>Examination</h4>

<p>Place patient on an angle table, i. e., one which rises in
the center and slopes away toward either end. Separate
the thighs slightly, patient lying face down, and insert the
rubber-covered second finger, palmar surface upward, very
carefully into the rectum. The tip of the coccyx may then
be felt and its movability and position determined. Unless
it is immovably fixed in an abnormal position it should not be
molested; the movable coccyx responds to mere muscle
tension by changes of position and cannot act as a primary
cause of nerve impingement.</p>

<p>Usually this examination will be rendered unnecessary
by the external palpation which may disclose the movability
of the coccyx and at once render further exploration superfluous.</p>

<p>When the coccyx is anteriorly subluxated and ankylosed
in that position it may be a factor in producing constipation,
hemorrhoids, etc., but its influence in other diseases, especially
of the nervous system, has been greatly overrated by
those who have not yet fully accepted the doctrine that
nerve impingement is the primary cause of all disease.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 30. Edge contact with “Roll,” q. v. Attitude of patient
for coccygeal adjustment.</div></div>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>When it has been decided that the coccyx must be
moved, the position and use of hand is the same as for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
palpation. The finger hooks under the tip of the coccyx,
draws upon it until a tight contact is secured and then
jerks sharply backward upon it with a view to its abrupt
fracture. No mitigation of the jerk in the hope of
previously loosening or gradually replacing the bone is of
value for <em>osseous tissue</em> must be broken before any movement
may take place.</p>

<p>This movement is painful and the region of the newly
fractured coccyx may remain sore for a period ranging
from a few days to several weeks. It is wise to warn the
patient of the facts before proceeding.</p>

<p>The fractured coccyx may be absorbed, or may be reankylosed
in a proper position or in a new abnormal position,
or may remain loose and movable.</p>

<h3 id="adjustcurvatures">ADJUSTMENT OF CURVATURES</h3>

<p>We have previously discussed in detail the nature and
discovery of curvatures. A few words should be said here
about their correction.</p>

<p>If the sole object of the adjustment is to correct the
curvature it is best to select for adjustment those vertebrae
which are most subluxated in the direction of the curvature.
According to the length of the curvature a series of from
two to six, separated by some distance, are chosen. These
are adjusted until they cease to be the most prominent ones
in the curvature and then others, then most prominent, are
chosen and adjusted until they in turn cease to be most
prominent. In this way the curvature may eventually be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
straightened, or nearly so. It is doubtful if any curvature
can be absolutely eradicated, although it may be straightened
until unnoticeable except by the expert.</p>

<p>To overcome a curvature it may be necessary to break
every rule which governs ordinary adjusting and to invent
new ways of placing the hands or of delivering force. No
two require exactly the same measures and he is most successful
with curvatures who is most adaptable to changing
conditions.</p>

<p>One rule may be safely laid down. Do not alternate
from day to day, loosening at the same time many vertebrae,
but choose the ones most in need of adjustment and <em>follow
your choice</em> as long as it is indicated. The chief vertebra is
nearly always the one at the <em>angle</em> or <em>point</em> of the curvature.</p>

<p>The sharp, angular curve of Potts’ Disease, involving
two or three vertebrae, should warn against adjustment,
usually, since in this disease the vertebrae are fragile and
easily fractured. If a case has not progressed too far a
cure may be effected, but great caution in taking such cases
must be exercised. Every Chiropractor should be well
informed on the diagnosis of Potts’ Disease, or spinal caries.</p>

<p>Many months are usually required for the straightening
of a curvature—how many can scarcely be estimated in
advance of the experiment with any case. Often the case
which seems simplest requires the longer time, while a very
pronounced curvature, as in some cases of rachitis, may
yield in a few months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h_36">PREFERABLE ADJUSTMENTS</h3>

<p>The selection of the move with which to correct each
subluxation depends upon the adjuster’s concept of the <em>kind</em>
and <em>direction</em> of the subluxation and of the mechanics of
the different corrective moves in his repertoire. The move
used should be one in which the application of force is
exactly along opposite lines to the lines of force which
originally produced the subluxation.</p>

<p>Omitting involved explanations as to the elements of
each displacement and the manner of change in bone,
muscle, ligament, cartilage, etc., and presupposing a comprehension
of the principles of each adjustment named,
there follows here a list of possible subluxations of each
vertebra in turn, from Atlas down, with a simple statement
of the RIGHT MOVE for that subluxation.</p>

<p>In each instance there are other moves than the one
listed which would <em>move</em> the vertebra and some which would
partially correct it, but none which would quite so definitely
tend to <em>correct the displacement</em>. Unfortunately it is not a
fact that every movement of a vertebra is an adjustment. If
this were true subluxations would not exist, because they
could never have been produced. Too often the adjuster
uses a move because it is easy, because its use has become
habitual with him, rather than because it is indicated by the
conditions of the case—then blames Chiropractic because his
results are negative or bad.</p>

<p>The move which is suited to a certain kind of subluxation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of one vertebra may be quite out of place with another,
in a different part of the spine. Thus the Recoil is quite
proper for a posterior Lumbar and is contraindicated with
a posterior middle Dorsal.</p>

<p>If all vertebrae were shaped exactly alike, if all were
equal in size, if subluxation were possible only in one direction,
then one method of adjustment would be quite sufficient.
Diversity of technic is demanded, but a discriminating
diversity, with a good reason for every move used.</p>

<h3>A FINAL WORD</h3>

<p>Some useful information pertaining to adjustment will
be found in section entitled, “Practice,” q. v.</p>

<p>After a careful and painstaking study of the foregoing
pages it will still be found that the student is not by any
means equipped for the work. He must <em>practice</em> these
things to learn them. We learn to do by <em>doing</em>. The chief
use of this section will be as a reference and guide during
the practice of adjusting.</p>

<h2 id="h_37"><a id="THE_CAUSE_OF_DISEASE"></a>THE CAUSE OF DISEASE</h2>
</div>

<h4>Disease a Morbid Process</h4>

<p>Disease has been variously regarded as an entity, a process,
a condition. It has been mentioned in terms which
would almost personalize it, such as, “attacked by pneumonia,”
“seized with cramps,” “in the clutches of tuberculosis.”
Men have endeavored constantly to discriminate
between diseases and to learn the appearance and peculiarity
of each, and have resolved each into its peculiar elements
only to learn that the merging lines between two diseases or
between cases of the same disease are imperceptible. It is
no more possible to define any one disease within exact limits
and to distinguish it from all others than to consider one
function of the human body without studying its interdependence
with others.</p>

<p>Disease is a <em>process</em>. It is a natural process. It follows
certain well-defined laws and consists in the abnormal performance
of function in some bodily organ or organs, or in
the untimely performance of some function which would be
normal in its proper chronological relation with other functions
or at another period of the body’s development. The
balance of function of the body is destroyed—some function
intensified or diminished—that is all. Every disease, properly
studied, reveals its functional base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>Disturbances of the functions of <em>growth</em>, <em>nutrition</em>, and
<em>repair</em> produce changes in structure, physical evidences of
disease. It is probable that every disease has a certain
amount of structural change connected with it; it is hard
to conceive of functional derangement without structural
change, in a universe in which Nature is eternally building,
destroying, or modifying organic peculiarities to meet changing
functional demands. But in many instances this structural
change is so slight as to be undiscoverable; such
diseases are called “functional” to distinguish them from
those in which structural pathologic changes are directly
discernible, called “organic.”</p>

<h4>Beginning of the Process</h4>

<p>Recognizing the fact that disease consists in a succession
of steps or a series of events, each depending upon the
next preceding one and making possible its successor, and
desiring to arrest or check this process and correct the
damage done, in other words, “to cure disease,” the question
arises, “Where does this process begin?”</p>

<p>If we wish merely to check the process or to modify it,
as does medicine, the etiology of the disease is less important
than the present state. It is then more important that we
understand the changes which are taking place in the body
at the time of our attempt, the condition of each organ at
that time, and the general recuperative or resisting power of
the individual.</p>

<p>But if we would correct all the damage done instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
merely preventing further damage or building up internal
resistance against a still active destructive process; if we
would so eliminate the effects of the earlier steps as to make
the resumption of the disease process most improbable, we
must know each step from the beginning to the present,
understand their sequence and relation, and go back to the
beginning with our correction, <em>removing the cause</em>.</p>

<h4>The Cause of Disease</h4>

<p>Since each event in the morbid process depends upon
the preceding one and makes possible those which follow, it
is possible to stop at any point in the chain of events and
declare, “Here lies the Cause of Disease.” This explains
the various etiologies adhered to each by a school of intelligent
and scientific men, yet each apparently disagreeing
most flatly with the others. No matter which step we select
as our “ultimate cause” it truly is the cause, or one of the
causes, of succeeding steps, which succeeding steps may well
stand in our minds as the whole of the disease. Thus the
physician, having found a germ, is quite content to look
forward from the invasion of the germ and consider that
as the primarily necessary requisite for disease production.
In retrospect he follows disease back within the body to
the time of entrance of the germ and then leaves the body to
study the life habits of the germ and its favorite mode of
conveyance. He has unwittingly left the direct line of
investigation and followed a spur-track.</p>

<p>So with the osteopath who discovers contractured muscles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
drawing a member, or a bone, from its normal position.
He proceeds to a study of the effect of such contracture upon
other tissues and strives to relieve it by treatment—of the
muscle.</p>

<p>The dietist discovers that certain food combinations
cannot be properly cared for by an individual and that if
taken they tend to develop toxins deleterious to the system.
Whereupon he undertakes to discover food combinations
which the body <em>can</em> care for and believes that he has solved
the question of etiology.</p>

<p>Now it is <em>most</em> important that we find the <em>primary</em> cause,
the one which makes possible the operation of all the rest
and without which all would be powerless to harm man.
This we shall expect to find at the point of entrance of disease
into the human organism. The primary cause must
be the first step <em>which concerns man</em>, the first change from
normal to abnormal, on which all subsequent changes depend.
It is useless to pass outside of the consideration of
man and those forces which directly affect man, in our
search for the cause of disease. We are powerless to
affect outside forces or to control or amend the laws of
nature through which disease exists.</p>

<p>Let us attempt then to resolve disease into its successive
steps and to find the first which concerns man. Correcting
that, we shall have corrected, fully and completely, the
process which constitutes disease. By striking at the root
we may destroy the entire growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<h4>Vital Energy</h4>

<p><dfn>Irritability</dfn> is the property of being susceptible to excitement
or stimulation. Stimulation is the process of increasing
the functional activity of any organ. Inhibition is the act of
checking, restraining, or holding back the functional activity
of any organ. These definitions, taken from Gould, are
here introduced as a necessary preface to an attempt to set
forth, without unnecessary reference to, or discussion of,
any other theory as to the etiology of disease, the Chiropractic
explanation of its presence.</p>

<p>Chiropractic maintains that all the chemical and physical
activities of the human organism are controlled, directly
or indirectly, through a third form of energy transmitted
through the Nerve System; that while all three forms of
energy are interdependent and closely related in their ultimate
expression, one of the three is the <em>primary</em> and most
essential form, and especially indicative of life. We may
call this third form <dfn>Vital Energy</dfn>.</p>

<p>There are several good reasons for believing that this
nerve force is the primary form in which energy is expressed
in man and for believing that it controls and directs the
others in greater degree than it is controlled and directed
by them.</p>

<p>Of the four forms of tissue of which the body is composed—connective,
epithelial, muscular, and nervous—the
latter is the one damage to which is followed by the greatest
and most permanent consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>It is a fact that there are several organs whose removal
leads to certain death because of their importance in the
general economy of the body, but it is also true that section
of the nerves leading to these organs just as certainly
causes death by the cessation of their functions. There is
no organ in the body aside from the nerves themselves
which does not immediately cease to act upon withdrawal
of its nerve force and at once begin a process of degeneration
or atrophy.</p>

<p>Pathologic changes in the Nerve System invariably are
followed by pathologic changes in the organs controlled by
the diseased segment but the converse is not true. Excitation
or inhibition of nerve activity produces corresponding
and responsive change in the activity of the organs innervated,
but excitation of an organ does not necessarily produce
similar changes in the Nerve System. That system
possesses the power of inhibiting or permitting responsive
action, in other words, the power of <em>choice</em>.</p>

<p>Research in Comparative Anatomy develops the fact
that the differences in power of complex action possessed
by different organisms are entirely measurable by differences
in the structure and complexity of their nerve mechanisms.</p>

<p>Further, by studying the effects of removal or extirpation,
or of pathologic changes in various parts of the nerve
system it has been demonstrated that the Brain is the center
for those higher forms of activity known as psychic, for the
power of accelerating or inhibiting the responses of the
lower centers of the nerve system to stimulation from without,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
and for the conveyance of authority to act to all the
lower centers. The Nerve System is the morphologic,
physiologic, and dynamic center of the organism and the
Brain the center of the Nerve System. We may, then,
logically expect to find in the Brain, or in the channels by
which power is distributed from the Brain to lower centers
or organs, the initial step in the disease process, which
is our present quest.</p>

<h4>One Nerve System</h4>

<p>All nerve tissue in the body is organized and linked together
in a complicated aggregation of individual units,
communicating by <em>contact</em>, and forming one great Nerve
System having its directing center in the Brain. It is said
by some writers to consist of two distinct systems—cerebro-spinal
and sympathetic—but would better be described as
consisting of central organs—brain and spinal cord—and
peripheral organs—cranial, spinal, and sympathetic peripheral
axons connecting with cells in the central axis and
linked together in a net-work improperly separable into
separate or distinct divisions, the fibres of different parts
being bound together in such a way as to establish an intricate
intercommunication, closest on the one hand between
the cranial and sympathetic and on the other between the
spinal and sympathetic. The sympathetic system may be
regarded as nothing more than a medium for proper distribution
of impulses originating in the cerebro-spinal
system, and a series of reflex centers deriving their power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to act from the central axis. The proper action of sympathetic
ganglia has been demonstrated to depend upon the
integrity of the spinal nerve fibres, or rami communicantes,
which pass to and terminate in the ganglia with their telodendria
(terminal arborizations) in contact with the dendrites
(cellulipetal processes) of the ganglion cells.</p>

<p>It will appear that interference with one division or
part of the nerve system may be followed by effects partly
manifested through a distant part; that excitation or inhibition
of a spinal nerve may correspondingly excite or inhibit
sympathetic fibres.</p>

<h4>Chiropractic Hypothesis</h4>

<p>Chiropractic has accepted, as a convenient working
hypothesis amply justified by years of clinical experiment
and anatomical and physiological research, the proposition
that all disease in the human body is primarily made possible
by injury to (stimulation or inhibition of) some part of the
nervous mechanism.</p>

<p>Injury to other tissues, unless the injury also involves
nerve tissue, is quickly repaired and the body goes on without
disease. Or the injury is sufficient at once to render the
body untenable and death ensues. Few pathological changes
follow trauma unless nerve tissue be injured.</p>

<p>This theory to be logical must and does include the
entire nerve system. Also, since it is noted that each nerve
cell presides over the nutrition of its own processes and
possesses its own power of repair, it follows that unless an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
injury be of fatal nature or of permanent duration, even injuries
to nerves tend toward automatic cure. We must
seek a permanently operating interference with nerve tissue.</p>

<p>The brain, enclosed within the comparatively solid
cranium, is so well protected that nothing except fracture
of the skull, violent concussion, or shutting off of its
blood supply from without, will produce permanent change
there. Also, unless there be pressure by foreign substance
against the brain, an injury will be repaired in time and
the body resume its normal functional activity. It has been
demonstrated that comparatively few diseases occur in this
way. Such as do are called traumatic; i. e., caused by
wound or injury.</p>

<p>In the broadest sense all disease is caused by trauma, as
we shall presently show.</p>

<p>The upper or cephalic peripheral nerves, called cranial,
leave the skull by foramina in its base (except the auditory)
and are so protected by the immobility of the bones of the
skull as to be comparatively free from direct injury. Peripheral
injuries occur to cranial nerves but are repairable;
even section of the trigeminal for neuralgia is usually followed
after an interval by a reunion of the severed parts.
As will be shown later, the special end organs of the cranial
nerves are not free from the effects of spinal subluxation
and their nuclei (deep origins) often share in morbid
changes in the brain tissue due to nutritional disturbances.</p>

<p>The sympathetic portion of the nervous system might
be classed with the cranial as regards infrequency of permanent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
interference were it not for the proximity of the
great gangliated cord to the transverse processes and bodies
of the vertebrae. This proximity renders it liable to sustain
permanent impingement in vertebral subluxation.</p>

<h4>Trauma Affects Spinal Nerves</h4>

<p>With the exception of the first pair of Cervical nerves
and the Sacral and Coccygeal, all spinal nerves pass through
foramina of exit which are composed each of two movable
vertebrae. The Chiropractic hypothesis is based upon the
discovery that in addition to the part these vertebrae may
take in general movements of the spine it is possible that
their relation to each other may be changed by the application
of force from without, and that this change once produced
tends to remain permanently. These permanent vertebral
subluxations occur with great frequency, a fact clinically
demonstrable by palpation and by the X-Ray.</p>

<p>The discovery of this fact led to the ascertaining of two
more, namely,</p>

<p><em>No disease is ever found without accompanying subluxation.</em></p>

<p>Since each organ or tissue is connected with some definite
and special vertebra, subluxations accompanying disease
bear a relation to disease which is controlled by a
general law, operative alike on all human organisms.</p>

<p>The latter fact required one other for its complete demonstration;
namely, that the removal of the subluxation is
always followed by the complete disappearance of the disease.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Given more perfect methods of correcting subluxations
it would follow that proof of the Chiropractic theory
would be so complete and overwhelming as to meet at once
with general acceptance. The difficulty lies in the fact that
with our present methods much time is often required for
complete correction of the vertebral displacement and much
skill is needed even for successful investigation of the results
obtainable. The theory is too often judged by unskilled or
imperfect applications of it.</p>

<p>Every school of Chiropractic accepts the presence of the
subluxation and has spent much thought and time in the
effort to deduce the law governing its connection with disease.
Diverse conclusions have been reached owing to the
difficulty experienced in completely eradicating the subluxation.
When it <em>is</em> accomplished the results are absolutely
conclusive. When it is partially or relatively accomplished
the results are so good in a great per cent of cases as to
lead sometimes to the erroneous belief that the subluxation
did not cause the disease since mere partial correction of
the subluxation suffices to bring about the apparent total
removal of the disease. In every case of thorough experiment
the results warrant the recommendation of the subluxation
theory as at least a proper working hypothesis.</p>

<p>Without attempting here to review all the various conclusions
reached or the methods by which they have been
attained, we would simply state our own conclusion, which
we believe is the only one compatible with demonstrable
facts. It is briefly this: Since every portion of the body is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
connected through the nervous system with the spinal nerves
and since it has been proven that this connection is reasonably
constant and anatomically demonstrable; since the
removal or correction of a subluxation leads in all cases to
the complete disappearance of disease from the organs or
tissues innervated from the subluxated portion of the spinal
column, we conclude that the subluxation is the <em>primary
cause</em> of disease.</p>

<p>The final test of the correctness of any theory is the
result of its application. Since Chiropractic secures a larger
percentage of results than any other known system of healing
it is safe to assume, at least, that it has discovered the
way to remove the primary cause of disease.</p>

<p>That the Chiropractic theory, or more properly the subluxation
theory, does not include all of the etiology of disease
is evidenced by the facts of contagion and infection,
by the effect upon the organism of the introduction of poison,
by the consequences of worry, anger, and other abnormal
mental states and conditions. These facts do not in the least
invalidate the theory. They merely require explanation which
will make clear their relation to the subluxation. That such
explanation is abundantly at hand strengthens the position
of Chiropractic more than would negation of all other causes
save the one we concentrate upon.</p>

<p>The Mentalist who holds that all diseases exist in and
are but figments of the mind is as far afield as the Physicist
who holds that special nerve energy is nonexistent. The
Chiropractor views Man as a complex psycho-physical unit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
self-operating and internally self-healing until environmental
forces disturb the nice adjustment of the machinery.</p>

<p>Disease is produced by, and is, a series of events, chief
and most permanent of which is the subluxation. We may
consider its etiology according to the order in which the
events take place thus:</p>

<h4>Direct Chain</h4>

<p>Concussion of Forces.</p>

<p>Subluxation of Vertebra.</p>

<p>Impingement of Nerve.</p>

<p>Excitation or Inhibition.</p>

<p>Disease—Abnormal Function.</p>

<h4>Accessory Chains</h4>

<p>Between the last two steps above, or following the last,
are often introduced one or more of the following accessory
chains which modify or increase the final effect and are
themselves made possible by the first four steps in the direct
chain.</p>

<p>Pathogenic germ.</p>

<p>Poisonous excretions from germs.</p>

<p>Tissue destruction by chemical action of such toxins.</p>

<p>Reflex muscular tension tending to increase subluxation
and thus augment nerve impingement and its effects.</p>

<p class="in0">Or</p>

<p>Dietetic error.</p>

<p>Abnormal chemical action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>Tissue destruction or nerve irritation by chemical poisons.</p>

<p>Reflex motor disturbances which further limit digestive
power.</p>

<p class="in0">Or</p>

<p>Abnormal mental condition.</p>

<p>Waste of nerve energy with production of toxins.</p>

<p>General metabolic disturbance.</p>

<p>Increased disease wherever disease previously existed.</p>

<p>These are offered merely as illustrations. There are many
accessory chains which aid in the production or development
of disease and act as <em>secondary causes</em>.</p>

<h4>Concussion of Forces</h4>

<p>Man was so created, so provided with means for repair,
growth, etc., that the body tends to maintain its own functional
balance—perfect harmony among all its parts—unless
interfered with by some outside agency. There are certain
natural laws such as the law of gravitation and the law of
momentum and inertia which operate without regard for
man or man’s welfare. If man, wittingly or unwittingly,
allows himself to come into violent conflict with one of
these laws by falling to the ground or in meeting sudden
and unexpected opposing force or mass while in motion,
that which may be termed a concussion is produced by the
meeting of the outside force and the internal bodily resistance.</p>

<p>Many such concussions may occur without serious damage.
Some produce wounds or injuries which it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
for the body to heal without causing serious disturbance of
function. Other concussions are so violent as to produce
displacement of structure which tends to remain permanently.
Under Spino-Organic Connection will be found an
explanation of the manner in which force applied to various
parts of the body tends to affect the spine.</p>

<p>Now the displacement of a bone cannot be corrected by
the body without outside aid. No method is provided for
such correction. Produced by outside force affecting the
body, it can only be reduced by outside force. It is this
failure of Nature to make man adaptable to <em>every untoward
circumstance</em> which renders him susceptible to disease.</p>

<h4>Subluxation</h4>

<p>As has been previously stated by no means all concussions
of forces produce subluxation. (All subluxations,
however, are produced by concussion of forces.) It may be
added that not all subluxations impinge nerves and that when
they do not so encroach upon nerve tissue they produce no
noticeable effect after the first temporary soreness has disappeared.</p>

<p>Every subluxation, however, evidences a <em>tendency</em> to
disease. Once moved from its normal position and the
poise and symmetry of the body disturbed, there are influences
which tend more readily to affect the same vertebra.
The subluxated vertebra is more easily disturbed by jars,
strains, etc., than the normal one because such jars are
less regularly distributed to all its parts. A reflex muscular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
tension due to other and more pronounced subluxations
and their disease effects may in turn increase the slight
deviations throughout the spine, rendering them in their
turn capable of producing disease. When the spine or any
part of it has lost its perfect regularity disease is made
<em>possible</em>, if not a fact at once. The average number of
subluxations in each individual is about nine and one-third.
Of this number probably not more than one-third (though
no accurate figures are available) are actually productive
of conditions nameable as disease at any given time. Discrimination
between those which do, and those which do
not, produce discoverable symptoms in a given case is a
matter which requires a nice technical skill and perfect
judgment.</p>

<h4>Impingement of Nerves</h4>

<p>When a vertebra has lost its normal articular relations
with its fellows and occupies an abnormal position as a
consequence in regard to <em>all</em> surrounding or adjacent tissues
it may impinge nerve tissue in two ways, by <em>tension</em>
or by <em>constriction</em>. By the displacement of one vertebra of
a pair the size and shape of the intervertebral foramen may
be altered (occlusion) constricting the nerve which passes
through the opening. That this change in the size and shape
of the foramina does frequently occur is shown by the frequency
with which alterations in the shape of vertebrae
appear in dry spines, by post-mortems which have demonstrated
the altered foramina in the cadaver and by permanent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
occlusion of the foramina in ankylosed spines so
that the occlusion may be preserved. Adding cartilage
changes in the intervertebral disks to alterations in bone
shape and position, especially the latter, we find full and
sufficient reason for all the pathological phenomena which
follow the subluxation. Explain it as you will, these morbid
results <em>do</em> follow subluxation and can be experimentally
produced in animals. Moreover, the disease may be directed
to a desired organ or region by selection of the particular
vertebra to be displaced.</p>

<p>The suboccipital, sacral, and coccygeal nerves cannot be
constricted as they pass through the foramina because they
do not emerge through complete rings formed of separate
and movable bones. But these nerves may be <em>pressed upon</em>
or stretched by displaced bone, as may also the great gangliated
cord of the sympathetic, especially the Cervical portion
of it. <em>Tension</em> of the Cervical sympathetic cord by
subluxation of vertebrae is a very common occurrence.</p>

<p>Whether the impingement be by constriction or by tension
the effect is much the same depending upon the degree
to which the molecular continuity of the nerve substance
is impaired—interference with the function of the organ
connected with the nerve and sometimes swelling and pain in
the nerve itself followed by degeneration. The effects are
chiefly noticeable in peripheral tissues. S. Weir Mitchell
says (1872), “A continuous pressure upon a nerve results
in the degeneration of the nerve and a disturbance of function
of the parts innervated by that nerve.” No clearer
statement can be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>It must not be understood that all nerve impingement
is due directly to subluxation of a vertebra. A dislocated
shoulder would produce a similar effect of nerve tension.
But dislocated shoulders are seldom met with as permanent
conditions. Likewise there may be secondary impingement
from new growths, themselves due to some primary subluxation.
Aneurism of the thoracic aorta often produces
hoarseness by impingement of the recurrent laryngeal.</p>

<p>Not all impingement is sufficient to produce noticeable
disease. To a certain extent the power of adaptation inherent
in the body can overcome its deleterious effects and
suppress all signs of its existence until an overtax upon
bodily energy lessens this adaptative power. Then disease
appears and we say that the overtax caused it.</p>

<h4>Excitation or Inhibition</h4>

<p>A slight impingement serves as a mechanical irritant to
increase the action of the nerve and the functions of the
attached peripheral organs. Such stimulation beyond the
normal is always followed by a reaction, or fall to subnormal
action.</p>

<p>Heavy impingement, especially the impingement due to
marked occlusion of foramina, partly or wholly paralyzes
the affected nerves. Often the impingement produces only
a latent weakness in some organ, a weakness which may be
brought to light only through the introduction of some secondary
cause which takes advantage of the susceptibility of
the organ to produce some definite disease. As an instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of this we may mention typhoid fever. No typhoid case is
found without subluxation in the region of the second
Lumbar; yet the latent weakness produced by that subluxation
may not have been observed until the typhoid germ
found a fertile feeding and breeding ground in the weakened
tissue and proceeded to multiply there and develop its
toxins.</p>

<h4>Effect Upon Single Cell</h4>

<p>Each nerve cell is trophic to its processes and to the
tissue cells to which these processes are distributed. The
growth, nutrition and repair of each cell of the body is
dependent upon the integrity of the axon which supplies it.
The effect of nerve impingement upon the single cell is a
weakening of cell structure and a disturbance, slight or
great, of the special function possessed by that cell. Dunglisson
says of diseases, “All ... are dependent upon
modified cell-action.”</p>

<h4>Effect Upon Organs</h4>

<p>Each organ is but an aggregation of cells of some special
type or kind. Nerve Impingement usually involves either a
whole nerve trunk or many of its fibres and thus weakens
either the entire organ or many of its cells and increases or
diminishes its special function. Some organs are innervated
by more than one nerve and may be injured only in part by
a localized impingement.</p>

<p>Alteration of the action of one organ often tends to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
affect the entire body, as in subluxation of the fourth Dorsal
interfering with the nerve supply to the liver the secretion
of bile becomes altered in character or quantity and the entire
system suffers, through deranged digestion, from this
alteration in a necessary secretion. Every disease presents
symptoms only indirectly referable to the organ which is
primarily affected and the problem of the diagnostician
is to so discriminate between direct and indirect symptoms
as to be able to <em>locate</em> disease.</p>

<h4 id="h_38">Simple Subluxation Disease</h4>

<p>We have considered a chain of events by which disease
is produced without the intervention of any secondary cause.
Such a condition may be called, for convenience, a simple
subluxation disease. Its existence depends directly upon
the subluxation which is the first change manifest in the
individual and upon which all the other changes depend.</p>

<p>The two facts that not all subluxations impinge nerves
and not all nerve impingements cause demonstrable disease
explain why we do not, in practice, find a disease to correspond
with each subluxation discovered by palpation. It
must be remembered that there may be latent weakness
following a subluxation and of importance because it
renders the patient susceptible to infection or to the action
of other secondary causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h_39">SECONDARY CAUSES</h3>

<p>Among the secondary causes of disease may be mentioned
the pathogenic germ, poisons, dietetic errors, abnormal
mental states, bodily excesses, exposure to sudden
temperature changes, and inhalation of non-poisonous but
irritating substances as the most common. Many others
might be included but these will suffice for complete illustration
of the principle. It will be our endeavor to show
how each of these secondary causes operates by virtue of
a previous susceptibility, or breaking down of the normal
resisting power of the organism caused by subluxation, and
how each in turn <em>may</em> bring about increase in subluxation
and thus, both directly and indirectly, increase disease.</p>

<p>Bear in mind these two all-important facts. <em>None of
these secondary causes can operate without previous subluxation.
A subluxation may produce disease without the
aid of any secondary cause.</em></p>

<h3 id="h_40">GERM DISEASES</h3>

<p>These comprise a large portion of the febrile affections.
Most germ diseases are characterized by fever and the
presence of circulating toxins with resulting disturbance of
the metabolic processes of the body.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed among pathologists that the
greater number of varieties of micro-organisms found at
times in man are not pathogenic. Some aid in the decomposition
of food in the alimentary canal; others have various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
beneficial functions to perform. But some, under proper
conditions, feed upon and destroy living tissue. These are
the so-called pathogenic germs.</p>

<p>The pathogenic germs are many. They enter the body by
various routes, in the air we breathe, the food we eat, the
water we drink; sometimes they are communicated by
direct contact with other persons or with objects infected
with them. The term “contagious” is applied to those diseases
whose germs may be carried through the air from
one to another; “infectious” refers to those communicable
only by contact.</p>

<p>In every healthy individual are found multitudes of
germs of both the pathogenic and harmless varieties. We
are constantly exposed to the influence of the former yet by
no means all bodies into which pathogenic germs find entrance
contract disease. This fact has caused much study
and among pathologists and bacteriologists generally the
conclusion has been reached that the development of colonies
of micro-organisms sufficiently to produce disease depends
upon what is known as “susceptibility” of the organism.
There must be a latent weakness of which the micro-organisms
take advantage.</p>

<p>This amounts to the admission that the body contains
the inherent property of successfully resisting all germ
action. Indeed, the fundamental proposition of Serum-Therapy
is that under stress of the presence of dilute germ
infusions the body <em>does</em> develop special chemicals which
neutralize the germ poisons and kill the germs and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
remain after the inoculation to guard against any further
entrance of germs of the same kind and vulnerable to the
same protective chemicals.</p>

<p>This theory is sufficiently correct to have served as
an unassailable basis for a most illogical procedure. The
truth is that the auto-protective power of the body must
be lower than normal and the germs must find a weakened
area for development and multiplication before they can
develop sufficiently to produce disease. Once they gain a
foothold they tend to multiply with great rapidity and to
develop alarming symptoms often leading to death.</p>

<p>Only in a few instances does modern science believe
that a pathogenic germ can successfully attack a healthy
body, but is claimed that there are a few germs, such as
the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus (diphtheria producer) and the
bacillus of anthrax, which may find lodgment in any organism,
healthy or unhealthy, to produce disease.</p>

<p>Now, the susceptibility of the body to germ invasion requires
explanation. Merely to say that one is susceptible
and another is not leaves too wide a field of possibility for
error. It is easy to reason from the fact that all persons
are at some time exposed to contagious or infectious diseases
while comparatively few contract them that some persons
are vulnerable to certain diseases while others are not. It
is plain that while a person may be susceptible to typhoid
fever because he has a weakness in the intestines, he may be
quite immune from pneumonia or tuberculosis or any other
infectious or contagious disease. But why this difference?
Let us look at the problem from another angle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>Chiropractors find with every contagious or infectious
disease certain subluxations whose location with relation to
the disease is constant and demonstrable. Thus all cases
of pulmonary tuberculosis show a third Dorsal subluxation
with only enough exceptions to prove the rule; tonsilitis is
invariably accompanied by subluxation of the second, third
or fourth Cervical. Correction of the subluxation is, in all
except the most fully and virulently developed cases, followed
by a radical cure. Indeed, in many of the germ
diseases it is possible to abort the fever with improvement
of all symptoms in from five minutes to twelve hours. We
are so accustomed to checking germ diseases at once that
failure to do so leads us to immediate investigation of our
palpation and adjustment to discover some technical error
in the application of the principles of Chiropractic to the
case in question.</p>

<p>It is manifestly impossible by vertebral adjustment to
raise the body beyond <em>normal power</em>. Nothing is added to
the body; no energy is utilized other than the energy of
the body itself which is provided by Nature and released
through restoration of the normal carrying capacity of
nerves. The highest goal attainable is normality, and it is
observed that no matter whether the impingement be in
the nature of an excitation or an inhibition of nerve action
the effect of a correct adjustment is always in that direction—toward
normality. It may be as well to digress here
long enough to remark that abnormal change is never the
result of <em>adjustment</em> but always of <em>maladjustment</em>, and those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
who claim to be able to produce stimulation by moving a
given vertebra one way and inhibition by moving it another
are entirely wrong.</p>

<p>It is evident from the results of adjustment in germ
disease that the normal body is entirely capable of throwing
off the poisons and exterminating the germs, which conclusion
quite agrees with science. The fact, not known by
other branches of science, and asserted by Chiropractic is
simply that <em>the subluxation is the factor which determines
susceptibility</em>.</p>

<p>Upon ascertaining that a certain vertebra is in normal
alignment we may say with absolute certainty that the organs
innervated by the nerves passing through its foramina
are not and cannot be the site of any pernicious germ
activities. To go further, it has been demonstrated in a
number of cases that the subluxation existed before the contagion
or infection developed. A man has been known
to have a second Lumbar subluxation for many years
without effects other than a tendency to constipation and
on the appearance of a typhoid epidemic to contract the disease.
Correction of the subluxation afforded a cure. Such
instances might be cited in great numbers. No person without
the necessary subluxation ever contracts a germ disease
and the necessary subluxation can be exactly located for
the vast majority of such diseases. Unfortunately it is
impossible to find a person who has not <em>some</em> subluxations
and is not, therefore, subject to <em>some</em> form of contagion or
infection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>So far Chiropractic agrees with general knowledge of
germ disease and its etiology, simply adding the explanation
of susceptibility which all other modes of investigation have
failed to afford. In one particular we find apparent disagreement.</p>

<p>We have said that several bacilli are supposed to have
power to cause disease in healthy bodies. Diphtheria is a
disease caused by one of these. Yet Chiropractic adjustments
have rapidly aborted diphtheria, apparently proving
that the body has power to react strongly enough to conquer
even this germ, providing the nerve channels be opened
to allow of exertion of its full activity. It is probable that
all diseases fall under the same law and that <em>no</em> germ can
find lodgment in healthy tissue. Chiropractic affirms this as
a truth and as yet no experience has tended to disprove it;
the belief is strengthened by the years.</p>

<p>The experiments which are said to have proven that
certain micro-organisms can attack healthy tissue are based
upon the supposition that careful examination demonstrated
the absence of disease in the animals experimented upon by
inoculation. Since these experiments and these examinations
were made without any knowledge of vertebral subluxations,
and consequently without discovering whether or not there
existed latent weaknesses of various organs, we doubt the
validity of the experiments. Our own examination of
human and animal spines has thus far failed to discover any
perfectly normal specimens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>Our clinical experience with diphtheria at least absolutely
disproves the conclusions of Pasteur and others in regard
to its origin.</p>

<h4>Increase of Subluxations</h4>

<p>It has been observed that in many instances the subluxation
which existed previous to infection or contagion is
greater and more noticeable during the febrile and active
stage of the disease than before, and this fact has led some
careless or insufficiently skilled palpaters to assume that
the disease caused the subluxation.</p>

<p>The development of germ life is accompanied by the
excretion of toxins of greater or less virulence which
circulate through the blood and affect the entire body. This
poison, irritating sensor nerves, brings about motor reactions
in the segments irritated and, since the normal operation
of the laws of reflex action is interrupted somewhat by
subluxation, and since the muscles immediately around a
subluxated vertebra tend to pull upon it with unequal leverage,
this motor reaction is likely to <em>increase</em> already existing
malalignments, especially in the same body segment in which
the poison is generated and in which the irritation is consequently
greatest. Thus subluxation is most pronounced
during the activity of the disease caused by it and reacting
upon it and thus a disease which began as a localized
destructive process may manifest systemic effects through
its action upon other abnormal spinal segments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h_41">DIET</h3>

<p>The internal chemistry of the body varies so greatly
under changing conditions, the operation of any two different
organisms is so hard to compare accurately, that it
is impossible to set down any rule for diet which will apply
properly to all patients or to all with the same disease or
habit of body. In fact, only experiment with an individual
can determine the exactly proper diet for him.</p>

<p>Through lack of judgment or of observation of the effects
of certain foods upon us we often eat that which our
bodies cannot properly digest and assimilate. Sometimes
through accident or negligence we partake of food which
is proper in kind for us but improper in quality, perhaps
partially decomposed. Improper food, when taken into the
body, tends to exert a deleterious effect upon health. This
fact should not lead us to confine ourselves to reasoning
superficially that improper foods <em>cause disease</em> or that dietary
measures will <em>cure</em> disease.</p>

<p>Some Chiropractors have held that the hunger of individuals
for certain foods is a safe guide to a proper diet.
This is manifestly untrue in some cases; the voracious appetite
of the convalescent typhoid patient is an example.
But it would probably be true <em>if all men were normal</em>. Close
observation of a few exceptionally well-developed and normal
individuals has disclosed an interesting fact. If a man
has no subluxation in that portion of the spine which controls
the stomach, the ingestion of decomposing food, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
though the alteration be so slight as to escape notice on
casual examination, induces immediate vomiting followed
by no untoward consequences. Only occasionally does one
find persons without subluxations in some way affecting the
stomach; in such cases the body promptly rejects and expels
injurious material.</p>

<p>This carries us to the rather surprising conclusion that
<em>the normal person is not susceptible to the influence of bad
food</em>. In the majority of individuals, some degree of abnormality
existing, improper food has a decidedly bad effect.
Passing through the alimentary canal it is improperly
digested; toxins are developed; these chemically affect the
entire body, perhaps leading only to a congestion and inflammation
of some part of the lining of the alimentary
tract, perhaps producing a general fever, malaise, diarrhea,
and the other effects of a general poisoning.</p>

<p>It has been found that proper adjustment is followed by
quick relief in such cases, the commonest effect being the
rapid expulsion of the deleterious matter by vomiting and
diarrhea with breaking of the fever and lessening of all
symptoms.</p>

<p>It has also been observed that during the suffering from
dietetic error the subluxation controlling the stomach or
some part of the small intestines is often found increased in
degree with tension of the adjacent muscles. With adjustment
and relief of the other symptoms the muscular tension
tends to disappear. This motor reaction from the irritation
of food poison undoubtedly serves to <em>increase</em> subluxation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
already existing, thus intensifying effects. But for its primary
effect food poison requires a previous subluxation
lowering the natural protective power of the body. Food
poisoning is often a secondary cause of disease.</p>

<p>When it is found in any specific case that certain foods
exert a bad influence upon the progress of the case, that the
symptoms are aggravated by the taking of these foods, they
must be abandoned. Yet no rigid diet need be prescribed
in any case. Every patient will require a different diet, nor
is it possible to understand the intimate chemical relations
within the body sufficiently to fix a proper diet except by
experiment.</p>

<p>A word here about fasting. If improper food were a
primary cause of disease, fasting would be an effective,
though somewhat radical, removal of the cause of disease
and a logical procedure. Since improper food is <em>not</em> a primary
cause of disease and since nature requires food for
the repair work made possible through adjustments, it would
seem unwise for Chiropractors to prescribe fasting. Also it
is well to remember that fasting and starvation are synonymous
and their symptoms identical.</p>

<h3 id="h_42">POISONS</h3>

<p>Any substance taken into the body and not usable as
food may be considered poison. Most drugs administered
as medicine or used habitually are either directly poisonous
and commonly so considered or are poisonous in the sense
that they do not build but rather tend to injure the body. Injurious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
substances accidentally taken into the body; certain
products included in the preparation of otherwise nutritious
foods, alcohol, tobacco, etc., affect the body in varying
degrees but in accordance with the same laws. Poisons may
be internally generated through the action of pathogenic
germs or through the failure of the body to digest food and
to prevent injurious chemical changes in it. It has even
been said by some that abnormal mental states so affect
metabolism as to cause the formation of certain auto-toxins
which injuriously affect the entire body.</p>

<p>However poison may make its appearance in the body
its presence is associated with certain bad effects. Poison
may be corrosive, destroying tissue wherever it touches; it
may be stimulating, affecting the nerves so as to increase
their activity, following which waste of energy there is a
weakening reaction; it may be narcotic, lowering some
physiologic process below normal.</p>

<p>If a man without subluxation—and therefore normal—have
poison introduced into his body one of two effects will
follow. Either the poison will be sufficient to produce death
in a short time, and will do so, or the poison will be ejected
from the body and the patient recover naturally and without
treatment, and recover fully.</p>

<p>This is the statement of the ideal, not the real. The
fact is that no person has yet been found without subluxation
in some part of the spinal column. Occasional cases
have been reported but always by Chiropractors whose statements
are open to question on account of imperfect training<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
in vertebral palpation or a known habit of unconsidered
statement. And in the weakened body, whose natural protective
power has been lowered, the effect is different.</p>

<p>The body fails to throw off all the poison normally and
some of it remains in the circulation and tends to cause progressively
increasing damage. In addition to the direct
effect of the poison upon the tissues, the irritation of sensory
nerves gives rise to a motor reaction which increases subluxation
generally throughout the spine but especially in
the segment in which the sensory irritation is greatest. If
the poison be taken into the stomach the vertebrae affecting
that organ are most affected in the resulting motor disturbances.
When vaccine virus is introduced into the arm
the greatest influence is upon the last two Cervicals and
first Dorsal, causing increased weakening of the nerves to
the arm. If the vaccination does not “take” it is because
the body is so normal as to be able to take up and rapidly
excrete the poison or to neutralize it with an internally
generated antitoxin.</p>

<p>This tendency of poisons to increase subluxations already
existing has caused many to conclude that <em>new</em> subluxations
could be produced by the motor reactions from
poison. The laws governing reflex action make this impossible.
If a mild stimulus be applied in the segment occupied
by a given, and normally aligned, vertebra, the resulting
contraction will tend to appear on the same side as the
irritation and would—if sufficient to subluxate the vertebra—draw
it <em>toward</em> the irritated side. If a stronger stimulus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
were applied the resulting reaction would appear on <em>both</em>
sides and with sufficient intensity on the opposite side to the
irritation so that the difference between the contractions on
the two sides would never be sufficient to overcome the
fixity and inertia of the vertebra. If this bit of theorizing
be doubted, let me add that if poisons <em>could</em> cause subluxation
they would undoubtedly cause drawing of the vertebra
<em>toward</em> the irritated side—which is not the way we find
them in poisoning cases. Almost without variation, the
subluxation is <em>away from</em> the affected side. Such a subluxation
produces most impingement on the side of the irritation;
the only kind which could follow poisons would produce its
effects on the opposite side.</p>

<p>In acute poisoning cases which may possibly proceed to
a rapidly fatal termination, while immediate adjustment
may be sufficient to cause the expulsion of the poison and
the recovery of the patient it is probably wisest to administer
an antidote or to call a physician with a stomach pump.
Just so, the pulmotor should be summoned for gas asphyxiation;
but at least one case was recently encountered in which
an adjustment started the heart and artificial respiration
movements restored consciousness before the pulmotor could
arrive. There are few, if any, acute poisoning cases in
which an adjustment will not aid. Sometimes it should be
assisted by other measures not strictly within the province
of Chiropractic.</p>

<p>Chronic poisoning, such as lead poisoning from paint
work, yields well to adjustments providing the secondary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
cause, the persistent inhalation of lead fumes, be discontinued.</p>

<p>Poisons may wound or injure the body whether or not
it be normal; in such case they might properly be classed
with trauma. But no poison causes disease except through
the medium of vertebral subluxation previously produced.
Some subluxation which has never been sufficient to produce
active disease may be so increased by the action of
poisons as to be of serious effect even though the poison
has long since been eradicated from the body—for the subluxation
is permanent until affected by force outside itself.
In considering the etiology of any disease the possibility of
its being augmented by medicines, drug habits, or dietetic
errors should be weighed with other evidence.</p>

<h3 id="h_43">EXPOSURE</h3>

<p>By this term is especially meant exposure to sudden temperature
changes. The body may sustain a very high or a
very low outside temperature providing the change is gradual
enough so that the heat-regulating mechanism may
adapt itself properly to protect the body and maintain an
even temperature within. A sudden change from a very
warm room to a very cold atmosphere; a quick transportation
from cold air to a superheated apartment; or a sudden
draft of air whose temperature is sharply at variance with
surrounding air and therefore with the condition of the
body surface may have a very bad effect.</p>

<p>The skin and mucous membranes of the body have become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
accustomed to a certain temperature; the change irritates
them. And the immediate result is a motor reaction
increasing subluxation in the same body segment in which
the irritation is greatest and probably producing first an
irritation of the nerves at the spine and then an inflammation
of the exposed surface. Thus a “cold” is produced. One
who has no subluxation affecting the respiratory tract—a
rare degree of normality—may escape coryza, bronchitis,
or pneumonia, the most common effects, but may suffer a
congestion of the stomach walls or of other parts of the body.
It is said that the cold “settled on the stomach.” The fact
is that the motor reaction takes advantage of the weak parts
of the spine and affects them most, like the pernicious habit
of spine-stretching which used to prevail among Chiropractors.
This explains why “cold in the head” is so very
frequent. The fourth Cervical vertebra is situated at the
middle point of the neck and is very freely movable and
easily subluxated and, in fact, more often displaced than
other Cervicals.</p>

<p>Noxious or poisonous vapors may have an effect identical
with that of sudden temperature change. Sleeping in an
improperly ventilated room often appears to cause “cold.”
Careful study of the part of the body exposed to draft, and
of spino-organic connection, will show that in most instances
the effect of such exposure is first felt in the same body
segment.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that not all people are “subject
to colds.” One may be “subject to lung colds,” another to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
“cold in the head.” The susceptibility is entirely governed
by the condition of the spine, the person having no middle
Cervical subluxation being immune from coryza even though
subjected to the same exposure which will produce it in
others. The pollen of plants produces hay fever in the
susceptible in much the same manner that draft produces
coryza, both acting as secondary causes.</p>

<h3 id="h_44">BODILY EXCESSES</h3>

<p>In this division of secondary causes may be mentioned
overwork, continuous loss of sleep, overeating, venereal
excesses, etc.</p>

<p>They act in this manner. Wasting and overusing the
bodily resources they lower the general vitality. Now,
though there be subluxations at various points in the spine
there is still transmitted through each impinged nerve a
certain amount of Vital Force which to a certain extent
maintains the functions of the body and keeps it in a state of
activity sufficient for ordinary demands. When the entire
stock of vitality is lowered through excess the amount of
energy passing through each nerve in the body is lessened,
but the effect of such lessening is felt most where there is
subluxation. At the high tide of vitality the subluxations
are not sufficient, perhaps, to produce serious disease. At
low ebb, every organ whose nerve is interfered with suffers
keenly. Under such conditions the body is much more subject
to adverse influences, to shocks and jars, to contagion
or infection, to the action of cold or exposure. Thus
bodily excess acts as a secondary cause of disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<h3>ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES</h3>

<p>There are many who believe that fear, worry, hate, grief,
etc., are in themselves sufficient to produce disease in a
normal organism. Shock following the demise of a loved
one or some deep disgrace is occasionally alleged as a cause
of death or of a rapid decline in health which terminates
fatally.</p>

<p>The failure of Suggestive Therapeutics to cure disease
except when it is largely imaginary rather argues against
this theory. It is also true that proper Chiropractic adjustments
not only lead to the cure of disease apparently
caused by abnormal mental states but also, restoring proper
blood-supply and nutrition to the brain, induce a happier
mental state in the patient. Even insanity has been cured in
a number of cases by Chiropractic.</p>

<p>We hold that worry, fear, etc., are abnormal; that they
arise from the improper expression of Mind through disordered
brain-cells. “Diseases of the Mind,” in the strictest
sense, cannot occur, but only diseases of the physical medium
through which mind is expressed and translated to the
physical plane of being—the brain.</p>

<p>A condition of abnormal mental expression or activity,
especially worry, fear or anger, probably has a two-fold
effect: it rapidly wastes the body energy and, like bodily excess,
renders every subluxation more effective; it is possible
that it may also really produce auto-toxins, generated by
abnormal brain-action and affecting the body metabolism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
adversely. In this way disease appears through the action
of abnormal mental states as secondary causes.</p>

<p>They themselves are the result of subluxation of the
first or second, sometimes third, Cervical, impinging the
nerves which control the blood-supply to the brain and
hence its nutrition. Correction of the subluxation causes
them to disappear.</p>

<h3 id="h_45">INFLAMMATION</h3>

<p>Inflammation is a morbid process characterized by the
presence of increased temperature and one or more of the
symptoms, pain, redness, and swelling. It is distinguished
from fever by being confined locally, while fever is a general
functional disturbance showing elevation of temperature,
increased katabolism, decreased secretion, etc.</p>

<p>Our clinical experience with fevers leads us to accept
Metchnikoff’s conclusion that the essential phenomenon of
inflammation is hyperaemia. Upon the hyperaemia depend
the swelling, pain, and local increase in heat-production.
Hyperaemia in turn depends upon disturbance of the vasomotor
nerves either as a direct result of some local subluxation
or as an indirect consequence of local irritation.</p>

<p>A newly acquired subluxation produces an acute irritation
of the pre-ganglionic axons which connect the spinal
nerves with the sympathetic ganglia. If these ganglia send
out post-ganglionic axons which are vaso-motor in function,
an inflammation may be produced without the intervention
of any secondary cause. On the other hand, there may be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
subluxation producing weakness of some part; through injury
to that part or the introduction of poisons or irritants
such as germ infection, sensory end-organs are affected and
the motor reaction which follows increases the subluxation;
this slight increase produces acute irritation of the nerve
and hyperaemia, with its resultant phenomena, follows.
Stated briefly, irritants produce inflammation only by acting
through the medium of the spine. If the spine be normal
these irritants are insufficient to produce morbid process.
Local inflammation tends to develop toxins, especially if it
be of bacterial origin, which may in turn affect the entire
organism—an effect which will be discussed presently. Exception
must be made in those traumatic cases in which
hyperaemia is essential to the reparatory process, and which
are attended by what may be termed a normally increased
heat-production. This beneficent and reparatory condition
cannot be termed disease or morbid process.</p>

<p>The normal temperature of the body depends upon the
balance maintained between heat-production and heat-expenditure.
This balance is maintained through a complicated
nerve mechanism consisting of various nidi in
thalamus, medulla, spinal cord and sympathetic ganglia, and
a network of communicating axons of both the cerebro-spinal
and sympathetic systems, controlling the amount of
blood passing through any given body area at a given time,
the secretion of the perspiratory glands, the internal metabolic
processes, etc. Most important are the vaso-motor
nerves, directly, but not originally, derived from the sympathetic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and governing the size and caliber of all blood-vessels
so as to control the amount of blood flowing to and
through the surface capillaries on the one hand, or the deep-seated,
heat-making organs on the other. More than seventy
per cent of the body’s heat expenditure is through the skin
by evaporation, radiation, and direct conduction. The major
portion of the heat production is in the muscles and the
parenchymatous viscera, such as liver, spleen, etc., where
metabolism is active.</p>

<p>This mechanism is so delicately adjusted that when the
outside temperature is lowered the amount of blood passing
to the skin is reflexly lessened while internal heat production
is increased and the bodily temperature retained at normal.
Conversely, the body perspires freely and the surface
is flushed with blood in a high temperature, so that heat
production is lessened and its discharge accelerated, again
tending to maintain an even and normal temperature.</p>

<p>The nervous mechanism is responsive to many and various
forms of stimuli—thermic, emotional, mechanical, physiologic
need, toxic. Poisons in circulation may affect the
bulbar center and produce general fever. A number of centers
in the spinal gray may be stimulated with like result.
Or there may be purely local irritation which results in
local hyperaemia and inflammation.</p>

<p>It will always be found that the primary cause of any
permanent derangement of the mechanism lies in vertebral
subluxation impinging some of the nerves and thus throwing
the mechanism out of its natural balance and poise. Other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
forms of disturbance are transient and the very nature of
the mechanism makes it normally capable of adjusting itself
to thermic, mechanic, or emotional stimuli in a short time.
Only the subluxation produces permanent elevation of temperature.
When such elevation does occur there are many
associated changes, increased katabolism, lessening of secretions,
anorexia, sometimes mental changes, such as delirium
or coma. Fevers vary according to the part of the nerve
mechanism affected and the action of any secondary causes.</p>

<p>Fever due to vertebral subluxation alone without any
secondary cause operating is very rare. Ordinarily fevers
come about in this way. A subluxation occurs which weakens
tissue and permits germ invasion; toxins enter the circulation
from the germ action and motor reaction increases the
original subluxation and causes local inflammation; germ
activity is favored by the increasing degree of abnormality
and toxins from rapid tissue destruction are added to those
already present. The poison-loaded blood then affects the
general centers for heat regulation, blood becomes internally
engorged, and a chill (internal fever) followed by general
increase of temperature occurs. At this juncture any subluxation
previously existing is likely to be increased and to
add its quota of harm to the rapidly developing picture.</p>

<p>Our problem is to find the original subluxation which
controls the site of the original pathologic change and to
correct that. In nearly all cases where this is done, even
partially, the body is enabled to care for the remainder of
the damage and to throw off the accumulated toxins. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
not uncommon that the temperature falls two degrees in
five or ten minutes after a proper adjustment. We expect
always to abort or check a fever in twenty-four hours or
less.</p>

<p>There are cases in which the temperature drops after
adjustment but presently rises again. This indicates the
virulence of the autointoxication or that some other area of
poison production is operating than the one our first adjustment
would control. A correct diagnosis will enable one to
give specific adjustment and check practically any fever
except a chronic one with much tissue destruction already
accomplished; even some of these yield.</p>

<p>The commonest cause of fever is at the fifth or sixth
Dorsal vertebra, long known as Center Place, or Fever
Center. Here emerge many pre-ganglionic fibres which distribute
their impulses through lower neurons in the sympathetic
system to the coeliac plexus and thence to the blood-vessels
supplying the major portion of the abdominal viscera.
Adjustment here causes a sudden contraction of these abdominal
vessels and a forcing of the blood to the surface
with rapid cooling.</p>

<p>Often, however, this adjustment is followed by a recrudescence
which indicates that some other vertebra must
be adjusted. Many fevers, such as typhoid, pneumonia,
tonsilitis, etc., yield to specific local adjustment without any
involvement of the so-called Center Place.</p>

<p>I have said that we expect to check or abort a fever with
spinal adjustments. The facts that we do so and that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
more rapidly we accomplish the result the more rapid the
convalescence and the less likely are complications and
sequelae argue loudly against the correctness of any theory
which supposes fever to be a beneficial and cleansing process.
According to such theory it would be totally wrong
and dangerous to abort a fever but wiser to encourage it in
taking its course. The exact opposite proves true under
Chiropractic. The very fact that fevers <em>do</em> diminish and
disappear under proper adjustments is a proof that they are
abnormal, since adjustment does not in any case tend to
lessen normal processes, but only to restore normality no
matter in what way the functions of the body have departed
from that condition.</p>

<p>All the clinical evidence gathered by Chiropractors in
regard to inflammations and fevers tends to prove the correctness
of the theories herein set down. Fever plays a
part in so many diseases that it has been considered advisable
to consider the subject under a special head.</p>

<h3>IN CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>The vertebral subluxation is the primary cause of all
truly pathological conditions. Through its existence the
action of a large number of secondary causes becomes possible.
Upon no other hypothesis can we explain the remarkable
percentage of cures of all known classes of disease
through the specific vertebral adjustment.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="h_46">THE PROCESS OF CURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Nature is the only real <em>curative</em> agent. Neither suggestion,
manipulation, adjustment, nor any other known
method applied by Man for the eradication of disease has in
itself any power to heal. No man possesses power to do
more than so arouse the vital energies of the patient that the
body heals itself.</p>

<p>We contain within our own bodies the possibilities of perfect
normality. Unless interfered with by powerful outside
force we should continue normal from birth to death
and death itself would only occur through the simultaneous
wearing out of all the parts of the human mechanism. The
Chiropractor, insofar as his work succeeds in its purpose,
assists the body by adjusting displaced structure and affording
the body a free and unhindered opportunity for the
exercise of its own self-healing powers. It may be interesting
and instructive to analyze the process of cure and to study
the exact effects of vertebral adjustment as we have studied
the exact effects of vertebral subluxation.</p>

<h4>Cure of Simple Subluxation Disease</h4>

<p>An acute subluxation—that is, one resulting entirely
from concussion of forces within twenty-four or forty-eight
hours prior to the moment of adjustment—rarely produces
a condition which could be named as any particular disease.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
The symptoms are those of “wrenched back,” if any. A
single adjustment usually suffices to correct such subluxation
just as a single movement might correct a dislocated humerus
within the same period, and any symptoms promptly
disappear. This is probably the maximum benefit to be
derived from adjustment and the best time for its administration,
because it leaves the spinal column in an exactly
normal condition and no more susceptible to further jars or
shocks than before the injury. All disease which might
have resulted from that subluxation has been fully prevented.</p>

<p>Older subluxations must be dealt with differently because
they present a different condition. Adaptative changes
have taken place in the shape of the vertebra itself and of
every surrounding tissue as they prepare to make the best
of their situation. But a vertebra once displaced has lost
its poise and broken or modified the reflex arcs through its
nerves so that it becomes more likely to respond to further
forces applied, or to muscular contractions within the body,
by further change of position. Such changes are always followed
by further adaptation of the surrounding parts.</p>

<p>The degree of nerve impingement must change to keep
pace with the developing malposition and thus, by gradually
successive steps, disease develops in the area of peripheral
distribution of the nerves. The nerve is under a thumbscrew
gradually tightening.</p>

<p>To adjust such a vertebra many successive movements
are required. An apparently full and free movement of a
subluxation meets the elastic resistance of the solidly packed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
tissues and the pull of the modified intervertebral disk—strains
at these tissues—and rebounds so as to settle almost,
but not quite, in its old abnormal position. The amount
gained in a single adjustment can rarely be appreciated by
palpation. To the touch it would appear that no change had
been made, except occasionally in the Cervical region. But
with repeated adjustments the vertebra will be found to
have approached its normal position. Sometimes in a few
weeks, sometimes in a few months, the gain becomes palpable
and then perhaps visible to the eye in thin subjects.</p>

<p>The relief of impingement then is not usually an instantaneous
process, but proceeds by gradual steps. Each
movement of the vertebra is accompanied by a shock to the
nerve against some part of which the bone is pressing, which
may produce some disturbance in the diseased organs and
may even appear to have aggravated disease for a time.
Some pain and soreness around the vertebra may accompany
the necessary adaptative changes of shape which readapt
the tissues to their proper shape and relation.</p>

<p>As the impingement of the nerve is gradually relieved
the disease is gradually modified and finally disappears.
As the course of adjustments nears its conclusion and the
impingement has been reduced to a comparatively slight one
there may appear a stage of irritation of the nerve which
is a reduplication of the first steps which appeared in the
development of the disease. As most subluxations appear
not all at once but by a series of changes, so disease develops
synchronously, passing from stage to stage with the changes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
in the impingement. Often it passes through first an acute
and active stage due to irritation and then a chronic and
comparatively passive stage due to heavier, inhibiting impingement.</p>

<p>Under adjustment these successive stages tend to reappear
in reverse order, the most alarming sometimes appearing
last and just before the cure is completed. It must
be remembered that from the moment one practitioner administers
medicine or other remedy and the other adjusts a
vertebra, the clinical courses differ widely. No text-book
on medical practice has as yet described the clinical course
of the various diseases under Chiropractic adjustment.</p>

<p>In chronic diseases where the nerves are paralyzed there
may be a period under adjustment during which no change
is apparent. This is followed by a period of rapid gain
leading to complete recovery. This may be accounted for by
the fact that the nerves are degenerated and must be repaired
all along their course before communication is reestablished
between nerve centers and peripheral organs.
When this repair is sufficiently completed to allow communication,
the cure is really well advanced, although evidence
of it then first appears. This has been noted especially in
locomotor ataxia.</p>

<h4>Cure of a Germ Disease</h4>

<p>First, under adjustment, the acute or acutely increased
impingement is relieved. The caliber of the blood-vessels
is at once regulated and the destructive action of fever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
checked. At the same time the vitality of the local tissue
in which the germs are active is suddenly increased and
there ensues a struggle between the body, as represented by
its phagocytes and auto-protective chemicals, and the germs,
which if adjustments be continued results in the rapid destruction
of the germ colony. Also the elimination of the
toxins already in the body proceeds so rapidly that if the
fever can be held in check it takes only a short time for the
body completely to overcome and eradicate the germs.</p>

<h4>Cure of Mental Disease</h4>

<p>Mental diseases—so-called—usually depend upon disturbance
of the blood-supply to the brain, controlled by the
Cervical sympathetic. Adjustments, relieving the pressure
on the sympathetic ganglia or cord and perhaps the direct
impingement from the vertebral arteries, restore a normal
circulation to the brain. The time required by Nature to
effect a cure depends upon the rapidity with which the impingement
is removed and the amount and character of the
damage to brain tissue which must be repaired. The cure
often requires time for a change of materials in brain cells
or fibre tracts, by which they are reconstructed and again
become capable of expressing normal function.</p>

<h4>Cure of Dietetic Disease</h4>

<p>When the subluxation is corrected, or partially so, the
appetite changes and the craving for food becomes more
normal. Adjustments may lessen a voracious appetite, increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
a too capricious one, or abolish a perverted. At the
same time the stomach is enabled to digest its contents more
properly, the intestines to take it up and continue it, and
the tissues to assimilate that which is brought to them. The
body eliminates its waste with less effort and in some extreme
cases the first effect of the adjustment may be to
cause vomiting and diarrhea and thus purge the alimentary
tract of materials which have become unusable.</p>

<p>If injurious diet be persisted in the effects of the adjustments
will be partly counteracted, the tendency of the
poisons generated within the body being to increase subluxation
while the tendency of the adjustments is to correct
them.</p>

<h4>Cure of Poisoning Cases</h4>

<p>In acute poisoning by way of the alimentary canal and
sometimes when poison has been injected hypodermically,
the body rids itself of the menace to its integrity by means
of vomiting, diarrhea, and increased secretion of urine.
Chronic cases tend rather toward the gradual absorption and
removal from the body of the poisons and their cure depends
upon the cessation of the poisoning; i. e., it is useless to try
to cure a morphine case while the patient is still using the
drug.</p>

<p>In acute poisoning the muscular contraction often increases
subluxation and counteracts the effect of the adjustments,
so that it becomes necessary to give very frequent
adjustments until relief is had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<h4>Cure of Exposure Disease</h4>

<p>After the acute irritation of nerves arising from the
exposure and causing irritation has been removed, perhaps
by the first adjustment, if the exposure is not repeated the
body heals itself with great rapidity, repairing with comparative
ease the damage done.</p>

<h4>Cure of Bodily Excess Disease</h4>

<p>This depends upon the nature of the excess. If it be
overeating, perhaps a more moderate diet will of itself and
without adjustments enable the body to rid itself of the bad
effects and restore general equilibrium. Adjustments will
aid and accelerate this process. Venereal excess is most
often engendered by an improper state of mind, perhaps
demanding attention as a mental disorder, or by an irritation
of the genital organs which demands local adjustment for
its relief. Normality of the reproductive tract leads to
sane forgetfulness and libidinous habits always suggest
sexual weakness or disease. Often where a cure would be
possible with right habits, no cure can be effected without
their correction. A little good sound advice which will
arouse the will of the patient to co-operation may aid. Boys
with the masturbation habit offer small chance for favorable
results in enuresis or nervous disorders unless the secondary
cause be understood and overcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h_47">ADJUNCTS</h3>

<p>In this connection the author cannot forbear a reference
to the use of other methods to relieve disease in combination
with the Chiropractic adjustment. From the foregoing
study of the laws governing the cause and cure of disease
it will be seen that therapeutical methods have little direct
bearing upon the removal of disease. The logical method
of effecting the cure is the removal of the cause. The subluxation
being always the primary cause, its correction is
always the logical method of effecting a cure. Not sometimes
but <em>always</em>.</p>

<p>We know that when the subluxation is corrected the
body naturally heals itself. Can we accelerate and aid that
healing with stimulant or narcotic? Logic says no; experience
says no: the use of any method which strikes at the
disease beyond its primary cause and operates upon some of
the effects of that cause without touching the cause itself is
inconsistent with belief in Chiropractic.</p>

<p>Administration of poisonous drugs to the well body is
considered poisoning; their administration to the sick body
is also poisoning, whose symptoms combine with the disease
to produce different outward signs. Fasting is starvation.
Massage is stimulation or inhibition. Spondylotherapy
means exhaustion of the spinal nerve centers in riotous
expenditure of their stored-up energy.</p>

<p>It would require a wisdom beyond the human to improve
upon the natural healing processes with which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
body has been provided. It should be our entire business
to remove the obstructions which hinder the full exercise of
that healing power—the subluxations—to remove them
dexterously and decisively and to interfere in no other way.</p>

<p>Other methods may and do serve to scatter or modify
disease but not to cure it—unless they affect subluxations, as
they sometimes do without intent. This accidental adjustment
factor is valueless in the presence of a scientific and
intelligent adjustment.</p>

<p>Let Medicine, Osteopathy, Spondylotherapy, Christian
Science, Massage, and Electricity have their field. It is not
ours. Nor can any of these methods be rationally combined
with Chiropractic. Their basic principles contradict ours;
their application interferes with the results of adjustment.
If you claim to remove the cause of disease, <em>do so</em>, and do
not mar your work by treatment of effects.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_48"><a id="SPINO-ORGANIC_CONNECTION"></a>SPINO-ORGANIC CONNECTION</h2>
</div>

<p id="h_49">It has been said in a previous section that when subluxation
and disease are associated the subluxation always
precedes the disease and that the former is the cause, the
latter the effect. So clearly do we understand this law that
we are able to say <em>what</em> subluxation would cause a certain
disease and err by only so many cases per centum as there
are variations from the usual structure of the spinal column
and the nervous system.</p>

<p>But merely to state that a second Dorsal subluxation
causes heart disease is not enough. We must know why and
how it causes heart disease and whether, perchance, some
other subluxation may sometimes have a like effect. We
must map out the sphere of malign influence of each possible
subluxation so that when our fingers encounter it it at
once and inevitably suggests its possible effects, from which,
by diagnostic methods, we may choose the one toward
which most symptoms point. And we must know the
relation of every nerve in the body to peripheral organs and
their functions so that when we encounter indubitable evidence
of some functional or organic disease we may know
exactly where, in the spinal column, to seek for its cause.</p>

<p>We have learned how to discover a subluxation, how to
adjust it, and how that adjustment permits a natural cure of
its abnormal effects. We must now learn exactly <em>where</em> to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
apply adjustment for any given organ in the body or for
any disease. It must be understood in interpreting this
statement and all those which follow in this section that it
is never proper to adjust a vertebra merely because it is
stated to be the cause of a disease believed to exist in a
patient. No vertebra should be moved unless palpation determines
it to be subluxated. Rather let it be known that
<em>as a rule</em> the statements of spino-organic connection here
made will prove to be verifiable by palpation. There is no
rule in Chiropractic without some exceptions, and mere
diagnosis of disease is too notoriously unreliable to serve as
a guide to adjustment without the verification of the trained
touch.</p>

<h4>The Field of Study</h4>

<p>We wish to know the relation existing between each
part of the Nerve System and other parts and between each
part and the other organs of the body. Especially we wish
to understand the relation between each part of the Nerve
System and the spinal column, by which permanent subluxations
of the latter interfere with the former’s action and
therefore with the peripheral organs.</p>

<p>This requires a general knowledge of anatomy, physiology,
and pathology which we shall presuppose the reader
to possesses so that we may present only facts to which his
attention should be particularly called. Let us begin with
the relation of nerve tissue to other tissues where this relation
can be most clearly comprehended, namely, with the
development of the human embryo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<h4>Segmentation</h4>

<p>The complete human organism represents the snarled
fusion of a series of similar, yet specialized, somatic segments,
each presenting most of the attributes of a simple
animal, though the association and co-ordination of all are
required for the production of higher animal phenomena.</p>

<p>The embryo is composed of such segments placed with
their centers in the same axial line. Each segment contains
in association which is morphologic, physiologic, and anatomical,
a segment of nerve matter and a somatic (body)
segment. The neural segments are arranged end to end so
as to form the rudimentary beginning of the complete central
nerve axis of the adult human body; the somatic segments
blend together with somewhat indefinite lines of
cleavage which are to become much more indefinite and
obscure by changes in relative form due to differences in the
growth rate of different parts or to involuntionary changes
following functional inutility at various periods. Gray says,
“The intrinsically segmental nature of the spinal cord is
expressed by the association of each definite segment with
the somatic segment supplied by its nerve.”</p>

<p>Within each segment there may be observed at an early
period cell migrations from the walls of the primitive neural
tube and amoeboid projection of axonic and dendritic processes
from these cells, which serve to bring the other
tissues of the segment under the control of the nerve elements;
there is an assumption of command, as it were, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the nervous system, so that the epithelial, connective, and
muscular tissues of each segment are linked in sensomotor
and vegetative co-ordination by the contact association of
the nerves which ramify them—sensomotor because the
nerves are presently to carry the only force capable of inciting
activity of any kind in other tissues, vegetative because
the functions of growth, nutrition, and repair, in each
somatic cell, depend upon the continuity of communication
between it and the lowest nerve cell in the nerve pathway
which connects it with the higher motor and sensor centers.</p>

<h4>Development of the Nerve System</h4>

<p>Already may be noted a hint and a prophecy of that
future segmental organization by which it becomes possible
for some spinal vertebra to become displaced and thus begin
a morbid process which may diffuse itself throughout an entire
body segment, involving neural and somatic elements
together. Already the simple organization begins to become
rapidly complex and difficult to trace.</p>

<p>Cell masses begin to migrate from the walls of the primitive
neural tube to a position laterad to become the spinal
ganglia; these send out long dendritic processes which marvellously
thread their way to a predetermined peripheral
connection which is to bring some cutaneous, or muscular,
or joint tissue into sensor relation with the dorsal, or Sensor,
portion of the cord and through it with the brain; at the
same time they send their axonic processes inward to mingle
with and communicate with the dendrites of other sensor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
cells remaining in the central axis to form the gray matter
of the cord, and thus, migrating, keep up communication
both with the central axis and the periphery. Other cell
masses migrate ventrolaterad to form the sympathetic
ganglia and they also send out afferent and efferent processes
which make a connection on the one hand with the
periphery and on the other with the source from which the
cells developed, the situation to be occupied by the cord.
From this view it is seen that the sympathetic system is
merely an offshoot from the same source with all the rest of
the peripheral nerve system, merely a mechanism for the
proper distribution of nerve impulses from the central organs,
and that it retains its connection in all its parts with those
organs. Its ganglia, like those of the cord, are always and
from the beginning under the domination of the upper or
cephalic end of the neural tube.</p>

<p>This cephalic end rapidly expands. Its growth is faster
than the rest of the neural tube and from its walls, by proliferation,
develop the structures of the cerebrum, mid-brain,
and hind-brain. It also gives off ganglionic masses from
which grow sensor processes to form the afferent elements
of the cranial nerves and contains, like the cord, motor
nuclei, or nidi, from which motor axons grow toward the
periphery to come into relation with definitely predetermined
organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<h4>The Spinal Column and Cranium</h4>

<p>Now appear the primitive cartilaginous and membranous
elements from which a bony wall is to be built around the
central nerve axis, primitive vertebrae, the upper known as
cranial and numbering four, and the lower, or spinal, numbering
usually thirty-three. These bone structures develop
around the brain and spinal cord. Later the cephalic vertebrae
fuse into a solid vault, the cranium, completely enclosed
except for various foramina for the passage of spinal
cord, nerves, and blood-vessels. The succeeding twenty-four
vertebrae remain separate and movable upon each other
and leave between them the openings for the emergence of
the spinal nerves. The last nine segments fuse eventually
into two immovable or false vertebrae called Sacrum and
Coccyx. These latter also contain foramina from which
nerves issue.</p>

<h4>The Adult Nerve System</h4>

<p>When this development and growth of new parts is
completed the Nerve System appears as a set of complex
organs made of a central axis, brain and spinal cord, and
peripheral connections made up of forty-three pairs of directly
attached nerves (12 cranial and 31 spinal) with two
great gangliated cords and numerous other sympathetic
ganglia and communicating cords situated outside the
skeletal axis but communicating with it intimately by means
of interchange of fibre bundles between the sympathetic and
the cerebro-spinal nerves.</p>

  nerves.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>But we who have viewed the embryonic development
even briefly and sketchily, understand that all these complex
organs are merely an aggregation of neurons, each neuron
made up of a cell body, one or more axons, and dendrites;
that the nerve cells are the controlling elements and the
axons the centrifugal carriers of nerve energy, while the
dendrites are the centripetal processes through which each
nerve cell receives communications.</p>

<h4>The Body Axis</h4>

<p>The skull and spinal column, taken together, constitute
the bony axis of the body, the center of organization of the
skeleton; to these parts are attached other skeletal structures,
mandible, ribs and sternum, extremities, classified as the
appendicular portion of the skeleton. Likewise are attached,
directly or indirectly, the voluntary muscles which move
the skeleton, and the vessels and viscera. Any given structure
in the body can be traced to a supporting connection
with this bony axis.</p>

<p>The bony axis contains the neural axis. Its strength and
solidity are such as to preserve the integrity of the most
vitally important tissue of the body from every form of injury
if such protection be possible. Through openings in
the bony axis—foramina—the central nerve organs give off
or receive the nerve bundles which bring them into communication
with every other structure of the body. And the
body has been so arranged that every single part of it is
partly or wholly under control of nerves emerging through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
these foramina. Even the brain and spinal cord themselves
respond to changes in the blood-vessels which are controlled
by nerve impulses which have emerged through the intervertebral
or cranial foramina and returned by other routes
to supply the muscular coats of the vessels.</p>

<h4>Concussion of Forces Affects Spinal Column</h4>

<p>Reverting for a moment to the primitive segmental arrangement
which is none the less persistent and important
because in the completed human the regularity of contour of
the segments has been wholly lost and aberrant organs have
moved from their original positions carrying their nerve
supply with them, let us first state and then illustrate a general
law.</p>

<p>Any violence applied to the body tends to affect the spinal
column. Such violence does or does not produce permanent
displacement of a spinal segment according as it does or does
not succeed in overcoming the internal resistance. But whatever
effect upon the spine is accomplished will occur most
noticeably in the same body segment to which violence was
applied. That is, force applied to any body segment tends
to subluxate the vertebra which would impinge the nerves
controlling that segment. Thus diseases are primarily segmental
and later general just as the body is primarily
segmental and later co-ordinated into complicated functional
systems, all more or less interdependent.</p>

<p>If a man falls so that he strikes first on the point of his
shoulder the force will be transmitted almost directly across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the line of the spine, at right angles, and may subluxate the
sixth or seventh Cervical or first Dorsal. If subluxation
occurs it is because the law of gravity causes the remainder
of the body to keep moving downward after the shoulder
strikes and until it too comes to rest. The subluxation
which results is a right one if the left shoulder be struck and
vice versa. Now the brachial plexus is chiefly controlled by
these three vertebrae and a right subluxation tends to impinge
most the nerves on the left side, so that if any permanent
effect of the fall follow it will be a permanent weakness
or disease of the left shoulder or arm, with possible
slight extensions along other branches of the same plexus,
as to the latissimus dorsi. Also by the internal sympathetic
communications from this same region the larynx, trachea,
or large bronchi may be affected, occasionally the heart, all
structures segmentally associated with the arm.</p>

<p>This law applies throughout the body and can be fully
demonstrated by any one having a complete knowledge of
nerve connections and body segmentation upon being furnished
with a complete and accurate history of any injury to
the body. It goes further than this. Toxins or other
secondary causes operating within the body tend always to
produce their motor reactions and consequent effect upon
any subluxated vertebrae in the same body segment with the
peripheral irritation, so that if the stomach contain a poison
which affects the spine the sixth or seventh Dorsal vertebrae
will be most affected and the stomach itself the organ to
suffer most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>The spinal column is peculiarly adapted, with its strong
ligaments, its cartilage cushions, its perfect flexibility and
flexuousness, to withstand jars and shocks. Yet the spine
is the door by which disease enters the organism. Concussion
of forces, the energy from the environment encountering
the bodily resistance, is of no serious effect upon
the organism—of no permanent or irreparable effect—unless
it affects the spine and brings about vertebral subluxation,
disturbance of the normal alignment between vertebrae, and
thereby interrupts the perfect healing and controlling influence
exerted by the vital part of the segment, the central
nerve portion.</p>

<p>When a concussion of forces <em>does</em> produce subluxations,
does disturb the perfect poise and balance of that center of
structure of the body, its consequences affect an entire body
segment, producing, or tending to produce, disturbances
through the entire segment.</p>

<p>Disease is the indirect consequence of the contact of man
with his environment and is <em>natural</em> but not <em>normal</em>.</p>

<p>The spinal column is a <em>center</em> or a series of centers for
disease. In this column will be found the primary cause—the
introductory element—by which disease first makes its
appearance in a previously healthy body.</p>

<h4>Comparative Anatomy</h4>

<p>The study of Comparative Anatomy is necessary to a
complete understanding of the human organism. We may
trace in the simplest forms of animal life the beginnings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
foreshadowings of the same plan of organization. We may
follow it through the ascending scale and watch its complexity
develop, and by viewing each step in the process we
may come fully to realize that the original plan has been
preserved throughout, though often in such form that by
study of the single species we should fail to recognize it.</p>

<p>We lack space for complete consideration of this subject
and shall merely suggest certain facts and phases. No
clear analogy can be drawn until we reach the worm, with
its rudimentary spinal column and nerves. Roughly speaking,
dissection of one spinal segment with its nerves and
their controlled area—if this were possible—would separate
from the rest a fairly regular <em>layer</em> similar to all the other
layers. This is the primitive segmentation.</p>

<p>It is shown much more clearly in the fish but the segments
have begun to curve with their periphery directed slightly
caudad and some have already shown a preponderating
growth over other segments and a change of shape from the
original symmetry.</p>

<p>The reptiles and birds show still more complicated segmentation.
It is notable that in these lower animals the
purely reflex portion of the nervous system is highly developed
while the volitional and sensory portions, the cerebral
hemispheres, are yet rudimentary. In birds, particularly,
the cerebellum is very highly developed because its function
of co-ordination of muscles for the maintainence of equilibrium
is required in a high degree for flying.</p>

<p>Those land animals which walk on all fours approach still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
closer but their arrangement is much more readily comprehensible
than in man. As the animal stands on all fours
with head extended, a gigantic cleaver slicing out each
vertebra and pair of nerves and slicing straight toward the
base of support might be said to divide the body <em>approximately</em>
according to the structural and functional arrangement
in segments. Yet no segment so separated would
exactly correspond to the nerve distribution; there would
be enlargement of some organs with extension into the zone
previously occupied by their neighbors; enlargement here
and atrophy there; invagination of one organ by another
and overlapping and intermingling of parts. Even the
relation between the spinal cord segments and the vertebrae
has departed much from the primitive so that the growth
of the vertebrae has exceeded that of the cord and the
cord terminates opposite the Lumbar region instead of at the
end of the Sacral canal. It may here be remarked that in
the human embryo the cord at first occupies the entire length
of the neural canal formed within the vertebrae; that in the
adult it terminates opposite the lower border of the body of
the first Lumbar vertebra and that the nerves, still retaining
their original foramina of exit and their relation to the
somatic segments, pass downward within the canal to their
respective openings and collectively form a brush like mass
called “cauda equina.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<h4>Causes of Segmental Changes</h4>

<p>The causes of the change in the shape, form, and relation
of the different segments are functional: the body changes
to meet the changing needs of its environment and the steady
progressive functional development from one species to
another.</p>

<p>When the animal at last assumes the erect position, doing
more intricately and intelligently the bidding of a developing
and improving central nervous system, the change
of position and the force of gravity bring about a gradual
downward, or caudad, tendency of the parts of the somatic
segments most remote from the spine and of the nerves
which supply them.</p>

<p>The nerves, muscles, and bones of the lower extremities
change from almost a right angle to an extremely obtuse
angle, less obtuse during infancy and more so in the adult.
The forelegs become arms and hang at the sides, extending
downward from the part of the spine which controls them.
The ribs tend more obliquely downward and outward from
the spine and the tendency of all the nerves is downward
from their attachment to the spinal cord to their emergence
from the intervertebral foramina. In the neck and head
alone is this rule varied, the tendency of the nerves and
some other structures there being to run from the spine
either at right angles or upward.</p>

<p>It seems almost symbolic and indicative of the purpose
of creation that the body, which is less strong and vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
in Man than in the lower animals, should tend more and
more obliquely downward from its central axis, while the
cranium, containing a highly specialized mass of cells and
fibres, the organ of Mind, which marks Man’s supremacy in
the animal kingdom and is his crowning glory, is reared
<em>above</em> the body it dominates.</p>

<p>In all the form changes which mark the growth of the
body the organs are arranged to afford the greatest possible
economy of space and convenience for use. This perfect
and matchless mechanism adapts itself to the changing habits
and environments and to the quality and needs of the Mind
which inhabits it.</p>

<h4>Necessity for Table of Spino-Organic Connection</h4>

<p>To the practitioner who is fully equipped with an instantly
available knowledge of all the nerve connections in
the body and to whom palpation of a subluxation at once
suggests its somatic sphere of influence as a weakened or
diseased area, or to whom mention of a disease immediately
calls to mind the organ, or segment, which is primarily
affected and its nerve connection with the spine, any tabulation
of spino-organic connection or of diseases and adjustments,
for reference, is unnecessary. But the ordinary practitioner
finds it difficult to acquire and retain such an array
of information and much more convenient to refer to reliable
and easily read tables which will supply at once any such
information desired.</p>

<p>No specific adjustment is possible without knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the vertebra which controls the part diseased and toward
the healing of which the nerve energy should be directed.
Specific adjustment without correct diagnosis is of course
impossible. And whenever correct diagnosis has been made
it is essential that the mind of the Chiropractor should
revert to one certain vertebra which he expects to find
subluxated as the primary cause of the disease.</p>

<p>Diagnosis is essential in order to find out <em>what</em> organ is
the site of the disease, for all disease is primarily segmental.
The <em>location</em> of the disease having been determined, a quick
reference to a table showing the spinal connection with
that location makes specific adjustment possible. The value
of specific, as against general, adjustments will be considered
under “Practice.”</p>

<h4>Method of Investigation</h4>

<p>One who wishes to determine for himself the proper
specific adjustment for a certain disease must, in order to
be able to attach any weight to his conclusions or to announce
them with any hope of credence by the scientific world,
proceed very much after the following method, which sets
down what may be termed “standard test conditions” for
research into the spino-organic connection.</p>

<p>He must make a correct diagnosis which serves to
determine the nature and location of the disease process.
In this he may be greatly aided by vertebral palpation and
nerve-tracing, especially in differential diagnosis. Any case
which affords less than a quite positively correct diagnosis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
should be excluded from the test list because any conclusion
based on a doubtful diagnosis must itself be doubtful and
may be seriously misleading.</p>

<p>He must then ascertain as far as possible the known
anatomical nerve connection between the spine and the diseased
part. If several connections are known he must
decide according to nervous physiology, by recognizing the
morbid functions which constitute the disease and learning
which nerves control these functions and which must therefore
be deranged in order that the disease may exist. I may
say right here that to attempt to answer the problems of
Chiropractic on the assumption that standard anatomies are
incorrect in their statement of nerve connections is as hopeless
as the wail of the schoolboy that the answers in his
arithmetic are wrong because his sums fail to come out that
way.</p>

<p>The investigator must next be accurate in Palpation,
selecting the subluxation which would, from his knowledge
of the body segmentation, seem most likely to influence the
nerves involved, and positively ascertaining the <em>number</em> of
the subluxated vertebra. No one who cannot count vertebrae
accurately can positively say which vertebra he has
adjusted. More than that, no one who <em>has not</em> counted the
vertebrae in the special case in question can say which
vertebra he has adjusted. No mere regional localization will
suffice for scientific investigation.</p>

<p>Correct and accurate adjustment must follow selection
of the single vertebra and the adjuster must know that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
has used the one special movement, or form of adjustment,
which is mechanically right for that kind of subluxation and
has so moved the vertebra as to release impingement. Mere
movement of a vertebra is not necessarily an adjustment or
even a maladjustment; it may be movement without permanent
change of relation or release of impingement. (See
“<a href="#h_36">Preferable Adjustments</a>,” <a href="#Page_155">p. 155</a>.)</p>

<p>There follows the observation of the progress of the
case and this must be so careful and accurate that the
observer knows to a certainty whether the disease is progressing
unfavorably, or favorably, or whether it has been
entirely eradicated. He must know the value of every changing
symptom, the real meaning of each new development.
Every diagnostic method should be at his command for
this work. Constant vigilance and constant thought should
mark each step of his work.</p>

<p>Finally he must be so cautious and careful in his statements
that no doubtful conclusion is allowed to escape from
his own mind. We may believe or suspect or hope for proof
of our theories but we have no right to state as a fact anything
except that which has been proven under the most
rigidly guarded scientific test conditions.</p>

<p>Failure to observe any of the precautions mentioned
renders worthless the results of investigation. Nothing
further than a mere presumption can be based upon research
which fails to observe all these rules. It will be
readily understood that there are few Chiropractors whose
training has been sufficient to enable them successfully to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
accomplish such research. There are thus many things
connected with the spino-organic connections which are
commonly held as facts but which should be classed as presumptions.
And the prevalence of the habit of general adjustment
rather than specific makes the future final solution
of all these problems remote.</p>

<h4>Kinds of Evidence Acceptable</h4>

<p>It will be seen that of the three kinds of evidence—Anatomical,
Physiological, and Clinical—which are admissible
in reasoning upon the connection between the spine
and disease, only one form—clinical evidence—has been adduced
by Chiropractic. For anatomical and physiological
corroboration of our apparent clinical findings we are obliged
to turn to standard works on these subjects; fortunately we
find it in abundance.</p>

<p>Anatomy, fortified now by research in the morphologic
relations of the parts studied and by physiological and pathological
experiment which has thrown much light on the
proper viewpoints from which to describe structure, contains
sufficient data on the nervous system to enable us to explain
practically every fact observable in a Chiropractic clinic.</p>

<p>It is true that there are a few statements in the ensuing
outlines for which we cannot as yet find the anatomical or
physiological proof. But it must be remembered that anatomists
and physiologists have never studied the body with
a knowledge of the subluxation theory to aid them in gaining
perspective and that Chiropractors, as a class, have not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
yet delved deeply enough into anatomy and physiology to
extract all the available and illuminating information from
them. Ofttimes the facts we value most are most obscure
in the texts because to others they seem least important.
But they are there. Armed with information concerning
Chiropractic facts it is probable that the scientist of the
future will corroborate all of our clinical findings of today
and emphasize the rational explanations of them.</p>

<p>In the following tables it has been found best to insert
in parentheses the capital letter (P) to call attention to any
statement in support of which we have gathered less than
all three forms of admissible evidence and which is therefore
as yet presumptive. It is well, however, for the practitioner
to be careful lest he regard too lightly such presumptive
statements. Unless there is very strong and reasonable
ground for such presumption or a general belief in its correctness
all mention of it is omitted. Those labelled presumptive
are merely so indicated because they have not yet
been proven and not because they have failed to serve as a
convenient and useful guide to adjustment. For each presumption
offered there is either clinical or anatomical justification
but not both.</p>

<h3 id="h_50">SPECIAL NERVE CONNECTIONS</h3>

<p>This section does not purport to state with any degree of
completeness the various nerve-paths by which spinal vertebrae
come into relation with all, or nearly all, the peripheral
organs of the body. It merely points out some of the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
interesting and important connections, some of the paths
which serve to explain the common effects of vertebral adjustment.
It is not expected that this resume of the subject
will be more than suggestive to the student; certainly
it cannot, in so brief a space, be a complete exposition.</p>

<h4>Outline of Nerve System</h4>

<p>Let us begin with the observation that almost every
organ of the body, including the central nerve organs themselves,
may be adversely affected by spinal subluxation impinging
spinal nerve axons at their exit from, or entrance
through, intervertebral foramina, or by spinal subluxation
producing direct impingement upon some part of the
sympathetic system and similarly interfering with its power
to functionate.</p>

<p>The Nerve System may be divided into two great divisions,
the central axis and the peripheral system which
distributes nerve energy from, and brings stimuli to, the
central axis. The central axis consists of the brain and
spinal cord; the peripheral system of 12 pairs of nerves attached
to the brain and having exit (except the eighth)
through foramina in the base of the cranium, 31 pairs of
spinal nerves emerging through intervertebral foramina
whose parts are movable upon each other (except the foramina
for sacral and coccygeal nerves), and an intricate
system of sympathetic fibres and ganglia arranged in a
double chain of ganglia in front and at the sides of the
vertebral column, three great prevertebral plexuses, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
cardiac, coeliac, and hypogastric, and numerous scattered
ganglia and communicating cords which bind the ganglia
together and connect them with spinal or cranial nerves
and with the periphery.</p>

<p>The peripheral system is somewhat complex and numerous
intercommunications are established by which nerve impulses
originating in the central axis and leaving by one
part of the peripheral system may exercise a controlling influence
over another part. Plexuses, or intertwinings of
nerve axons, are so numerous and complicated that it is
difficult to follow each set of nerve stimuli from their origin
to their final destination and effect without considerable
study.</p>

<h4>Direct Distribution of Spinal Axons</h4>

<p>The spinal nerve axons, taken as a whole, establish paths
between the motor gray of the ventral horn of the spinal
cord and all voluntary muscles of the body below the head
except the trapezius and sternomastoid, partially innervated
by the eleventh cranial, and between the sensor cells of the
dorsal spinal gray and gracile and cuneate nuclei of the
medulla on the one hand and the sensor end organs in skin
and mucuous membrane, muscles, tendons, and joints on
the other. The ventral cornu receives impulses from the
cortico-spinal axons of the direct pyramidal, crossed pyramidal,
rubrospinal, and other smaller tracts which bring the
spinal gray under the direct voluntary domination of the
volitional centers in the brain or of the indirectly voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
pathway through the cerebellum. The spinal nerves are
the direct media for motion of the body or its parts in relation
to its environment. The sensor gray of the cord is
similarly in communication with the conscious sensation
area in the cerebrum and with the cerebellum by way of the
dorsal tracts of the cord, the lemnisci, and the cerebellar
peduncles.</p>

<p>In the main these nerves of motion and sensation are
arranged as follows:</p>

<p>The Cervical plexus is composed of the intertwining of
axons from the anterior primary divisions of the four upper
Cervical nerves. Its branches pass to and innervate many
voluntary muscles of the neck and side and back of head,
and supply sensor fibres to the adjacent cutaneous areas.
Branches also communicate with the last three cranial nerves
and one long branch, the Phrenic, or Internal Respiratory
Nerve of Bell, passes through the neck and thorax to the
diaphragm, as its motor nerve.</p>

<p>The Brachial plexus is made up of the anterior primary
divisions of the four lower Cervical nerves and the greater
part of the first Thoracic. It is distributed chiefly to the
voluntary muscles and integument of the shoulder and arm,
forearm, and hand, but sends branches to some muscles of
the neck and upper back as well. It, like the Cervical plexus,
receives branches from, but gives none to, the Cervical sympathetic.</p>

<p>The Thoracic nerves are not arranged in plexiform
fashion like those above but pass separately, for the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
part, to their destinations. They are distributed to the walls
of the thorax and abdomen following the curve of the ribs in
direction. The last Thoracic sends one division downward
as far as the outer aspect of the ilium.</p>

<p>The Lumbar, Sacral, and Pudendal plexuses are formed
of the ventral divisions of the Lumbar, Sacral, and Coccygeal
nerves and distribute branches to the integument
and voluntary muscles of the lower abdomen, pelvis, and
lower extremities. From two of the sacral nerves branches
known as “Visceral” pass through the plexus to terminate in
the walls of the uterus and rectum.</p>

<p>All of the thoracic nerves and the first and second, sometimes
the third and fourth, lumbar give off branches to the
sympathetic ganglia, known as white rami communicantes.</p>

<h4>Direct Distribution of Cranial Nerves</h4>

<p>The distribution of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves is not
so definitely to voluntary muscles and to areas from which
conscious sensation is to be derived as is the case with the
spinal, although the cranial nerves present many analogies
with the spinal and there is abundant reason for considering
them as in one series of 43 pairs. There is direct distribution
of some cranial nerve fibres to secreting glands, but
these fibres are probably merely derived from sympathetic
trunks and carried in company with the axons of cranial
origin. There is also some direct distribution of cranial
nerve axons to visceral walls made of non-striated muscle,
as in the case of the vagus distribution to the respiratory and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
alimentary tracts and that of the spinal accessory to the
heart. This is a resemblance to the sympathetic.</p>

<p>The cranial nerves carry afferent impressions from the
special sense organs, except those of the sense of touch,
which function is divided with the spinal nerves.</p>

<p>Various intercommunications exist between the cranial
and sympathetic divisions of the peripheral system, by means
of which axons starting with one division may be finally
distributed with another, or by which an axon of the sympathetic
may pass to one of the sensor ganglia of the cranial
system and influence its nutrition and condition, and therefore
its power to act. There is a limited intermingling of
spinal fibres with the lower cranial.</p>

<h4>Distribution of Sympathetic</h4>

<p>The sympathetic system directly innervates most of the
nutritive or vegetative system, the alimentary tract and its
accessory organs, the vascular systems, the genito-urinary
system, and the ductless glands. To a limited degree it
shares this control with the cerebro-spinal and to a much
greater degree it brings the central axis into indirect connection
with these viscera.</p>

<p>Gray says, “The distinction of the sympathetic system
from the cerebrospinal system is made merely for reasons of
convenience. The two systems are intimately connected
and the sympathetic is morphologically a derivative of the
central axis disseminated in connection with the nutritive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
apparatus and establishing relationships among the vegetative
organs.”</p>

<h4>Structure of Nerve Pathways</h4>

<p>Most pathways which carry nerve impulses from their
origin or inception to the organ in which they are finally
expressed as action of some sort or translated into sensation
or into stimuli which pass out reflexly over a connected
neuron, are composed of more than one neuron. The neurons
of a nerve pathway are arranged end to end with the axons
all pointing in one general direction so that the nerve
energy travels always in the same direction over the entire
nerve path. Impulses are transferred from the first neuron
in the chain to the second, and from second to third, etc.,
by contact of the telodendria of the one neuron with the
dendrites or receptive processes of the next. Part of the
nerve pathway may be within the central axis and part
within the trunk of a peripheral nerve.</p>

<p>Several peripheral pathways for afferent impulses may
be joined to an efferent pathway so as to complete reflex arcs
and the efferent cell be under the controlling influence of
some upper neuron coming down from the central axis with
the power either to permit or to inhibit the reflex acts which
would otherwise take place as a result of peripheral stimuli.
Several such lower cells may be under the domination of one
upper neuron.</p>

<p>In some instances the nutrition of ganglia or nerve
trunks, or of parts of the central axis itself, is under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
control of sympathetic neurons terminating in connection
therewith, so that interruption of the normal action of the
sympathetic neuron may be followed by effects manifested
through some distant part of the cerebrospinal system. In
the following pages we shall discuss nerve pathways with
reference to the explanation of diseases caused by vertebral
subluxation impinging nerves either by tension or constriction,
and therefore our grouping of parts will differ somewhat
from any anatomical or physiological grouping with
another object in view.</p>

<h4>Important Nerve Pathways</h4>

<p><i>To brain</i>: C 2, 3, or 4 to superior cervical ganglion by
direct impingement, through internal carotid nerve to sympathetic
plexuses following branch arteries from Circle of
Willis. The blood-supply of the brain is under control of
the cervical sympathetic and most brain lesions or diseases
are due to vascular changes leading to anaemia, hyperaemia,
inflammation, or hemorrhage.</p>

<p><i>To meninges</i>: Loop between first and second cervical
nerves to trunk ganglion of vagus and through meningeal
branches of vagus (P), or by way of internal carotid nerve
to pial sympathetic plexuses. (P) The connection of the
first, second, or third cervical with cerebral meningitis is
established clinically but there is still doubt as to the explanation.</p>

<p><i>Eye and Muscles</i>, <i>Retina</i>, <i>Optic Nerve</i>: The external
muscles of the eye, the four recti and two oblique with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
levator palpebrae superioris, are innervated by the Oculomotor,
or third cranial, and the fourth and sixth cranial,
which receive branches from the cavernous plexus of the
sympathetic derived from the internal carotid branch of the
superior cervical ganglion. As the ganglion lies in front
of the transverse processes of the second, third, and fourth
cervical vertebrae, direct impingement upon it by subluxation
of one of these vertebrae may cause strabismus or
other affection of the external ocular muscles.</p>

<p>The eye-ball receives filaments from the ciliary or
ophthalmic ganglion, which in turn is connected with the
cervical ganglion by way of cavernous plexus and internal
carotid nerve. This pathway controls the radial fibres of
the iris and dilates the pupil as a part of the light accommodation
reflex mechanism. Loss of pupillary reaction,
especially with small pupils, suggests upper cervical subluxation.</p>

<p>The retina, containing the cells of origin of the optic
nerve axons and being the special end-organ of the sense of
sight has no direct spinal or sympathetic connections but its
blood-supply, and therefore its nutrition, is influenced by
branches from the sympathetic which enter with the central
artery of the retina. Retinal hemorrhage has been cured by
cervical adjustment, C 2, 3, or 4.</p>

<p>The conjunctiva is innervated by the sympathetic and
by the fifth cranial, or trigeminal.</p>

<p><i>Olfactory Nerve</i>: Nerve of smell, distributed to the
Schneiderian membrane over the upper portion of the nasal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
septum and over the upper lateral wall. There is no known
connection by which the trunk of the olfactory nerve can
be reached by adjustment but the condition of the special
end organs in the membrane and their ability to functionate
depend not only upon the integrity of their axons but also
upon the nutrition and moisture of the membrane in which
they are embedded. This is under the control of the Vidian
nerve and of branches from the spheno-palatine, or Meckel’s
ganglion, both connected with the carotid plexus of the
sympathetic and therefore responsive to adjustment of C 2,
3, or 4. This is also the route by which epistaxis is usually
checked.</p>

<p>The external nasal muscles, like those of the rest of
the face except some of the muscles of mastication, get
their supply from the facial nerve, which connects with the
sympathetic plexus on the middle meningeal artery. It may
be said parenthetically here that peripheral facial paralysis
(Bell’s palsy) yields to adjustment and proves the value of
this connection. The nasal integument is under the sensor
control of the trigeminal and trophic disturbances may result
from its involvement.</p>

<p><i>Trigeminal Nerve</i>: This is the great sensor nerve of
the face and carries a motor division, the inferior maxillary,
to some of the muscles of mastication, as the temporal,
masseter, and buccinator. It has connected with it four
ganglia, which also receive sympathetic roots, and the
ganglion of origin of its sensor axons, the Gasserian or
semilunar, also receives direct sympathetic communications.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
The importance of this communication is shown by the
powerful effect of adjustment of third or fourth Cervical
for tic dolouroux.</p>

<p><i>Ear</i>: The external ear receives branches from the
vagus and from the first and second cervical nerves. The
middle ear and Eustachian tube are supplied by the tympanic
plexus made up of branches from the glosso-pharyngeal,
otic ganglion, facial nerve and the small deep petrosal from
the sympathetic on the carotid artery. By all these routes
communication from the third and fourth cervicals is possible
but especially is the latter important. The fourth cervical
is the especially frequent subluxation with middle ear
disease. To the internal ear and auditory or acoustic nerve
there appears to be no direct route from the spine. It has not
yet been conclusively established within the writer’s knowledge
that adjustments will affect auditory deafness but
Meniere’s Disease, inflammation of the semicircular canals,
has been cured repeatedly by adjustments of Atlas or Axis,
by what route I am unable to state.</p>

<p><i>Teeth and Gums</i>: It is probable that the only connection
between the vertebrae and the teeth is an afferent one by way
of the trigeminal. Toothache may be stopped by adjustment
of C 3, or C 4, but no evidence is at hand to show that the
condition of the teeth is improved or that more than a temporary
effect can be had. Trophic changes in the gums may
be due to vascular disturbances controlled by the sympathetic.</p>

<p><i>Tongue</i>: The hypoglossal, motor nerve to both the intrinsic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and extrinsic muscles of the tongue, receives direct
axons from the loop between the first and second Cervical
nerves. Sympathetic fibres pass to the blood-vessels and
secreting glands of the tongue.</p>

<p><i>Tonsils</i>: Receive fibres from the spheno-palatine ganglion
and by this means are brought under the domination of
C 2, 3, and 4. Abundant clinical evidence in tonsilitis,
simple, follicular, and suppurative, proves this to be the
practically, as well as anatomically, correct nerve connection.</p>

<p><i>Salivary Glands</i>: The parotid receives branches from
the great auricular nerve from the second and third cervical,
and from the sympathetic on the external carotid artery,
branches from the superior cervical ganglion. The submaxillary
and sublingual glands are connected with the
submaxillary ganglion, which receives a sympathetic root
and which, with the chorda tympani also carrying fibres
derived from the sympathetic, controls the secretions of
these glands.</p>

<p><i>Pharynx</i>: The pharyngeal plexus is a mixture of sensory
axons from the glosso-pharyngeal, motor components
from the vagus and probably sensor from the same nerve,
and sympathetic branches from the superior cervical ganglion.
All of these may be influenced by the upper cervical
adjustment.</p>

<p><i>Larynx</i>: According to anatomy the larynx is innervated
by the superior and inferior, or recurrent, branches of the
vagus and by sympathetic branches from the superior cervical
ganglion. Clinically the sixth cervical adjustment cures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
laryngitis and aphonia. The explanation probably lies in
the fact that the thyroid branches of the middle cervical ganglion,
lying in front of the transverses of the sixth, communicate
within the thyroid gland with the recurrent laryngeal
and with the external laryngeal branch of the superior
laryngeal.</p>

<p><i>Thyroid Gland</i>: “The nerves to the thyroid are amyelinic
and are derived from the middle and inferior ganglia
of the sympathetic.” (Gray.) The middle cervical ganglia
are situated in front of the transverse processes of the sixth
cervical vertebra. Clinically, the sixth cervical reaches
goitre.</p>

<p><i>Muscles of Neck</i>: The platysma is supplied by the
facial nerve; the sternomastoid by the spinal accessory and
cervical plexus; the infrahyoid region by the first three
cervical nerves; the suprahyoid region by the facial and
the ansa cervicalis; the anterior and lateral vertebral muscles
by the cervical nerves from second to seventh inclusive,
but especially the second, third, and fourth. It will be seen
that muscular disturbance in the neck may result from any
cervical subluxation. Torticollis, which usually involves the
sternomastoid, yields to the second cervical most frequently.</p>

<p><i>Lymph Nodes of Head and Face</i>: These lymph nodes
are controlled by the cervical sympathetic. Pathological
changes in one or more nodes requires careful cervical palpation
to determine the presence of a subluxation away from
the affected side.</p>

<p><i>Muscles of Back</i>: The trapezius is innervated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
spinal accessory and by the third and fourth cervical nerves;
the latissimus dorsi by the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical
through the middle or long subscapular. Occasionally
a tender nerve, traceable from the lower reaches of the latissimus
to the cervical region has mislead the practitioner
into imagining a cervical connection over the back with internal
viscera.</p>

<p>The second layer of the back is supplied by the third,
fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. The third layer is innervated
by the middle and lower cervical and upper three
thoracic nerves except the serratus posticus inferior which
is supplied by the ninth, tenth, and eleventh thoracic. The
fourth and fifth layer are supplied by the posterior primary
divisions of the spinal nerves and any given section of these
layers may be traced to a vertebra directly above, or
cephalad.</p>

<p><i>Thoracic Walls</i>: The parietal muscles of the thorax are
innervated by the intercostal nerves and a very definite
segmental association with the spine is traceable.</p>

<p><i>Diaphragm</i>: Phrenic nerve, which arises from fourth
cervical chiefly; lower intercostals, especially eighth and
ninth; and phrenic plexus of the sympathetic which may
sometimes be reached from the fourth or fifth dorsal vertebrae
through the gangliated cord. For motor disturbances
of the diaphragm adjust fourth cervical.</p>

<p><i>Abdominal Muscles</i>: These are supplied by the lower
intercostals and the transversalis and internal oblique make
connection with L 1 by the iliohypogastric. Cremaster is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
supplied by L 1 and 2 by way of the genital branch of the
genitofemoral.</p>

<p><i>Perineal Muscles</i>: The anterior perineal group are supplied
by the perineal branch of the internal pudic which
traces to the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves. The
posterior perineal and ischiorectal region is also supplied by
the sacral and coccygeal nerves.</p>

<p><i>Trachea and Bronchi</i>: Vagus and sympathetic filaments
from first and second thoracic ganglia. The latter receive
preganglionic fibres from first dorsal nerve in all probability,
as this adjustment reaches the bronchi.</p>

<p><i>Lungs</i>: The third thoracic ganglia connect with the
pulmonary plexus and establish a connection from third
dorsal vertebra direct to the lung parenchyma. The <i>Pleurae</i>
have a similar connection or may sometimes be reached by
the first dorsal.</p>

<p><i>Heart and Pericardium</i>: In 55% of all heart disease or
improper action the second dorsal is responsible; in 40%
the first dorsal, and perhaps in the remaining 5% the atlas
or axis. The former nerves (T 1 and 2) furnish pre-ganglionic
fibres which stream upward through the gangliated
cord to terminate in the three cervical ganglia in relation
with the dendrites of new neurons (amyelinic) which form
the superior, middle, and inferior cardiac nerves and pass
into the thorax to mingle with vagal fibres to form the superficial
and deep cardiac plexuses, controlling the heart.
Probably the upper cervicals occasionally affect the vagus
through the loop between the first and second cervical
nerves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p><i>Thoracic Aorta</i>: Controlled by sympathetic from first
thoracic ganglion or last cervical ganglion, and thus by
seventh cervical or first dorsal vertebra.</p>

<p><i>Abdominal aorta—Coeliac Axis</i>: The upper portion of
the abdominal aorta is innervated by the coeliac or solar
plexus of the sympathetic. Sub-plexuses from the coeliac
accompany the various branches of the aorta and are widely
distributed to the blood-vessels and to the glands and non-striated
muscle of the abdominal organs. The coeliac plexus
receives fibres from the right vagus and from the greater,
lesser, and least splanchnic nerves, by the latter route making
connection with the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic
from fifth to last. These ganglia receive pre-ganglionic
fibres from the thoracic spinal nerves in the form of white
rami communicantes, so that it is not incorrect to say that
the coeliac plexus and its branches are largely controlled by
the condition of the last eight thoracic nerves.</p>

<p>Through this intricate plexus it is difficult to trace the
relations of each abdominal organ with the particular vertebrae
of which subluxation would produce disease in said
organ. By the aid of clinical experimentation covering a
period of years and by diligent search among anatomies and
physiologies, we have arrived at the conclusions indicated
in succeeding statements.</p>

<p>The most important spinal connection with the abdominal
blood-vessels is that of the fifth dorsal vertebra, for the
fifth dorsal nerve, by its rami, seems greatly to influence
the caliber of the aorta and coeliac axis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p><i>Liver</i>: Fourth thoracic nerves (especially the right) to
gangliated cord, via great splanchnic nerve to coeliac plexus,
by hepatic plexus to interior of liver. The hepatic plexus
gives off the cystic plexus which controls the gall-bladder.</p>

<p><i>Stomach</i>: Sixth and seventh dorsal nerves by white
rami to and through the ganglia of the gangliated cord to
coeliac plexus. The gastric plexus is an offshoot of the
coeliac and gives off Auerbach’s plexus to the muscular
coat, and Meissner’s plexus to the submucous and mucous
coats of the stomach. The nutrition of the stomach walls,
their peristaltic action, and the secretory action of the stomach
glands are thus brought under the direct influence of the
sixth or the seventh dorsal subluxation.</p>

<p><i>Pancreas</i>: Eighth dorsal nerve by great splanchnic to
coeliac plexus, to hepatic and superior mesenteric plexuses,
and by the pancreatico-duodenal branches of the former and
pancreatic branches of the latter to the pancreas.</p>

<p><i>Spleen</i>: The coeliac plexus, the left semilunar ganglion,
and the left vagus and right phrenic nerves give off
branches which form the splenic plexus. Spinal connection
by way of ninth dorsal nerve, by rami communicantes to
gangliated cord to great splanchnic nerve to coeliac plexus
to splenic plexus. Many nerve pathways like this one are
less indirect than they sound; various names have been given
to different parts of the same pathway through which, often,
the axons pass without interruption. On the way from the
cerebral cortex to one of the abdominal viscera there may
be only three, sometimes four or five, neurons connected
end to end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p><i>Duodenum</i>: Coeliac plexus by way of duodenal branches
of hepatic plexus and branches from the superior mesenteric
plexus. Spinal connection from eighth dorsal nerve and
possibly branches from the upper lumbar ganglia of the
sympathetic may join the superior mesenteric plexus, as
results in duodenal disease are occasionally reported following
specific adjustment of L 1 or 2.</p>

<p><i>Jejunum and Ileum</i>: Connection same as for duodenum,
by superior mesenteric plexus. Adjustment of L 2 in typhoid
fever is undoubtedly correct so that it is probable that the
lumbar ganglia send branches to this vicinity.</p>

<p><i>Peritoneum</i>: Nerve supply to the peritoneum is rather
general owing to its great extent. It is supplied by the
sympathetic from both the lower thoracic and lumbar portions
of the gangliated cord through the various abdominal
plexuses and in general it may be said that any localized
peritoneal disease will yield to the same adjustment as would
be made for disease in the immediately subjacent organ.</p>

<p><i>Suprarenal Capsules</i>: These important glands are supplied
by amyelinic fibres derived from the gangliated cord
by the lesser splanchnic nerve and connecting with pre-ganglionic
fibres from the tenth dorsal nerve. The suprarenal
plexus is an offshoot of the coeliac.</p>

<p><i>Kidneys</i>: Tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal nerves by
way of lesser and least splanchnic nerves to renal plexus,
an offshoot of the coeliac. McConnell’s experiments and the
frequently duplicated clinical feats of Chiropractors prove
this to be a vital and dominant nerve pathway in kidney
disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ureters</i>: Nerves derived from inferior mesenteric, pelvic,
and spermatic plexuses. Most important connection
seems to be from first lumbar nerve by lumbar ganglia to
inferior mesenteric plexus.</p>

<p><i>Caecum and Vermiform Appendix</i>: The inferior mesenteric
plexus, which supplies these organs probably carries
to them chiefly fibres derived from the lumber ganglia which
complete a connection with the second lumbar vertebra,
especially on the right side.</p>

<p><i>Colon</i>: Third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, influencing
lumbar ganglia and thus inferior mesenteric plexus.</p>

<p><i>Rectum</i>: Lower lumbar ganglia by inferior mesenteric
and plevic plexuses, through superior and inferior hemorrhoidal
plexus to rectum. Adjustment L 4 or 5. Visceral
branches from the third and fourth sacral nerves also pass
directly to the rectal wall and sacral adjustment may affect
rectum or anus.</p>

<p><i>Bladder</i>: The urinary bladder is innervated by the
vesical plexus from the pelvic, and by sacral nerve fibres
direct. It is said that the vesical plexus contains many
spinal nerve fibres which are derived from the second and
fourth lumbar nerves especially. Clinically the second or
the fourth lumbar will control the bladder much oftener
than the sacrum.</p>

<p><i>Prostate Gland, Seminal Vesicles, Penis, and Urethra</i>:
By the vesical and prostatic plexuses derived from the pelvic
plexuses, divisions of the hypogastric plexus, which is
formed of the abdominal aortic plexus and filaments from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the lumbar ganglia. The latter receive filaments from the
second and third lumbar nerves. There is a connection with
the sacral nerves also by the pelvic plexus, though the
lumbar adjustment appears the more potent.</p>

<p><i>Testes and Scrotum</i>: Ilioinguinal from second lumbar,
genital branch of genito-femoral from second and
third lumbar nerves, internal pudic nerve from the pudendal
plexus, and spermatic and pelvic plexuses. The most effective
adjustment for scrotal or testicular diseases is L 3.</p>

<p><i>Uterus and Vagina</i>: Uterovaginal plexus from the pelvic
and containing spinal nerve fibres from L 4, L 5, and
sacrum.</p>

<p><i>Ovaries and Fallopian Tubes</i>: The ovarian plexus receives
fibres from the abdominal aortic and through it from
the lumbar ganglia, influenced by second lumbar adjustment.</p>

<p><i>Brachial Plexus</i>: The brachial plexus of spinal nerves
arises from the nerves from the fifth cervical to the first
thoracic inclusive and controls the voluntary muscles of the
upper extremity, with its integument. Muscle groups,
rather than single muscles, are represented for the most
part in the spinal segments giving off these nerves, and
the ramification of the nerves within the plexus is such that
almost any given muscle might be affected by more than
one spinal subluxation. Below are given the principal connections:</p>

<p><i>Pectoralis Major and Minor Muscles</i>: Sixth or seventh
cervical through internal anterior thoracic nerve and first
dorsal through external anterior thoracic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p><i>Shoulder Joint</i>: The joint, muscles covering the joint,
and integument of this region are innervated by the circumflex
nerve which traces through the plexus to fifth and
sixth cervical nerves. Sixth cervical adjustment usually
affects this joint.</p>

<p><i>Serratus Magnus Muscle</i>: Sixth cervical by long thoracic,
or External Respiratory Nerve of Bell.</p>

<p><i>Elbow Joint</i>: Sixth cervical vertebra by musculocutaneous
nerve.</p>

<p><i>Anterior Arm Muscles</i>: Sixth cervical.</p>

<p><i>Posterior Arm Muscles</i>: Seventh cervical and first
dorsal.</p>

<p><i>Lumbosacral Plexus</i>: This plexus, derived from the anterior
primary divisions of the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal
nerves, supplies the muscles and integument of the lower
extremity, taking with it axons derived from the sympathetic
by the lumbar ganglia to supply the blood-vessels, perspiratory
glands and sebaceous glands of this region. The latter
are responsive to adjustments of the first or second lumbar
vertebrae.</p>

<p><i>Hip-Joint</i>: Third and fourth lumbar nerves by femoral
and obturator or accessory obturator nerves and fifth lumbar
or first sacral by the nerve to the quadratus femoris or
the great sciatic. Fourth lumbar seems the most potent
connection and is usually adjusted for hip-joint disease.</p>

<p><i>Psoas Magnus Muscles</i>: Anterior branches of the second
and third lumbar nerves.</p>

<p><i>Anterior Thigh Muscles</i>: Supplied mostly through the
femoral nerve from the second and third lumbar nerves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p><i>Internal Thigh Muscles</i>: Second and third lumbar
nerves (chiefly but not wholly) through the obturator, accessory
obturator and femoral nerves.</p>

<p><i>Gluteus Maximus</i>: From the fifth lumbar and first and
second sacral nerves through the inferior gluteal branch of
the sacral plexus.</p>

<p><i>Obturator Externus</i>: Second, third, and fourth lumbar
nerves through the obturator nerve.</p>

<p><i>Posterior Thigh Muscles</i>: Fourth and fifth lumbar and
sacral nerves through the great sciatic.</p>

<p><i>Great Sciatic Nerve</i>: This great nerve, direct continuation
of the sacral plexus, arises from the fourth and
fifth lumbar and first three or four sacral nerves and is
widely distributed to muscles and integument of the lower
extremity. Sciatica, or sciatic rheumatism, is most commonly
relieved by adjustment of fourth or fifth lumbar
vertebra; but there is a condition commonly diagnosed as
sciatica which is really a sciatic neuritis and due to vasomotor
disturbance affecting the blood-supply to the nerve
trunk. This responds to adjustment of first or second lumbar
because the amyelinic fibres which control these blood-vessels
are derived from lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic.</p>

<p><i>Anterior Leg Muscles</i>: Fourth and fifth lumbar and
first sacral nerves through the anterior tibial.</p>

<p><i>Posterior Leg Region</i>: Fourth and fifth lumbar and
first and second sacral through the internal popliteal and
posterior tibial.</p>

<p><i>Knee-Joint</i>: This joint receives branches from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
great sciatic through both internal and external popliteal,
and from the femoral and obturator. It is therefore connected
with the lower lumbar and sacrum and with the
second lumbar. The latter connection seems oftenest involved
in knee joint inflammations.</p>

<p><i>Foot</i>: Fourth and fifth lumbar and sacral nerves
through the great sciatic and its branches.</p>

<p><i>Sensor Areas of Lower Extremity</i>: In general, any
given cutaneous area receives sensor branches from the
nerve which supplies the subjacent muscle area. For accurate
diagnostic purposes a good chart of sensor distribution
may be consulted.</p>

<h3 id="h_51">DISEASES AND ADJUSTMENTS</h3>

<p>The appended list includes the diseases with which the
profession has had experience but is not in any sense a
complete list of diseases. It is merely intended for quick
and handy reference. In obscure cases or diseases not
mentioned it is suggested that the practitioner carefully
diagnose the case with reference to the <em>location</em> of the morbid
process and then refer to Special Nerve Connections
to find the nerve pathway between the spine and the organ
indicated as the seat of the disease. Standard works on
anatomy and physiology will explain more fully the paths
and functions of the nerves but information gleaned from
them must be sought out and pieced together from scattered
statements and discussions.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>The correct use of the foregoing table depends entirely
upon correct diagnosis. Knowledge of the vertebra to be
adjusted for the correction of any disease is useless unless
the disease be recognized when met. Diagnosis may be, and
usually is, aided by Palpation and Nerve-Tracing, which
may be considered as divisions of diagnosis since the subluxation
and the tender nerve are evidences (symptoms) of
disease. But these two divisions can never wholly take the
place of a complete diagnosis which calls to the aid of the
examiner <em>every</em> harmless method of ascertaining the patient’s
condition. The part may not suffice for the whole.</p>

<p>The Chiropractor has an opportunity to become the best
of diagnosticians because he has at his command all the
usually taught methods and <em>in addition</em> Palpation and Nerve-Tracing,
which are especially useful in differential diagnosis.
(See “<a href="#h_54">Schedule of Examination</a>.”) The profession is at
present lamentably weak in diagnosis and as long as they
remain so they will fail to achieve the possible maximum of
results from the application of a theory which, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, is
applicable to all disease but which is often imperfectly applied
in practice.</p>

<h2 id="h_52"><a id="PRACTICE"></a>PRACTICE</h2>
</div>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The ensuing section is intended rather more for the use
of the practitioner than for the guidance of the student but
may furnish the student a preconception which will prepare
him somewhat, before leaving college, to meet the problems
of practice.</p>

<p>Just as too frequently the young Chiropractor overlooks
the fundamental logic of Chiropractic which may be epitomized
with the terse command, “Adjust the <em>cause</em>,” and considers
his practice as requiring him to dabble in every suggested
or discovered method of treating <em>effects</em>, so, too frequently,
the young Chiropractor is prone to consider that
his practice consists solely of the adjustment of vertebrae,
that he practices a mechanic art rather than a profession; too
frequently he overlooks the thousand details which lead to
and surround the adjustment and are essential to its success.</p>

<p>The practice of Chiropractic involves more than correct
technic. It includes the use of a vast fund of knowledge;
the constant study of diseases and of patients; the art of
controlling and directing others sometimes in their very
trivial acts. Successful practice requires a proper setting,
proper business methods, and a knowledge of psychology.</p>

<p>Anyone entering upon a profession assumes a great
moral responsibility and the greatest responsibility of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
falls upon the doctor, of whatever school. He enters the
stricken home at a time when all members of the household
are off guard, as it were, at a time when all turn to him as
to one of higher knowledge and of greater power for their
guidance and often for their strength in affliction; he becomes
the repository of their most sacred confidences. He who is
unable to meet this responsibility, to realize his influence and
his power and to prepare himself with care and conscientious
training to acquit himself well, has mistaken his calling.
He is unfit for his ministry.</p>

<p>The thorough student wrestles not alone with the technic
and the text-book branches necessary in practice but also
studies his profession from every possible standpoint, broadening
his field of usefulness wherever possible.</p>

<p>This section does not by any means contain all the information
not found elsewhere in this book but necessary to
the Chiropractor in his practice. It is intended merely to
suggest some of the many sides and phases of our work and
to open the way for a life study of humanity and of professional
life as a Chiropractor.</p>

<h3 id="h_53">OFFICE EQUIPMENT</h3>

<h4>Value of First Appearance</h4>

<p>The patient, upon first entering an office, consciously or
unconsciously forms an estimate of the personality and
standing in his profession of the occupant of that office.
This impression is gathered from the kind and arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
of the furniture and visible equipment, from the neatness or
disorder of the room, from countless little things which play
each their part in making up the whole appearance. This
first estimate is sometimes the only one, for an unfavorable
first impression may lead to the loss of a prospective patient.
In any case it will play a part in all subsequent judgments
which the patient may form concerning the Chiropractor and
his work.</p>

<p>Many patients entering our offices have no previous
knowledge of our profession; their minds are open and
curious, alert for new impressions of some sort. We may
impress them as we choose. Every good business or professional
man realizes the value of the first impression and
strives for a good one. Therefore, upon entering practice,
choose for yourself every article which shall have a place in
your office. Your surroundings will then truly reflect your
personality and will attract those upon whom that personality
can work in harmony and understanding. It is of no avail
to attract the type of patients you cannot hold, to draw
through the borrowed judgment or taste of another surroundings
alien to yourself and thus to attract people who
will at once sense the incongruity and be repelled by it.</p>

<p>Yet one may aspire. And if you are able to perceive and
appreciate truly professional surroundings you may hope
to school yourself by association and study to harmonize with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<h4>Choice of Articles</h4>

<p>In choosing the contents of your office keep in mind
good taste, utility, and the psychological effect upon all
visitors. Remember that you expect to spend many hours
each day in the company of your furniture, and select such
things as will contribute to a proper professional state of
mind in yourself. A Chiropractor’s profession is in many
ways like, yet in many ways unlike, any other. Therefore
his office equipment, while following in general the equipment
of other professional offices, must be selected with an
eye to the special and particular needs of the Chiropractor
and his patients. Too little attention has been paid thus far
by the profession to the selection of office equipment.</p>

<h4>Furniture in General</h4>

<p>The furnishing of an office depends upon the amount
and disposition of the room at your command. One must
have at least a waiting room and a private office even if a
single rented room must be cheaply partitioned to make the
division. A larger suite is a better investment when possible.
In the waiting-room should be found easy chairs,
library table, hall-rack, mirror, and an easy divan or couch.
The floor should be covered with a good rug or carpet and
the walls properly and cleanly decorated and hung with
restful, pleasant pictures. A book-case filled with carefully
selected books is a good addition.</p>

<p>On entering your private office the patient should see
your diploma, which hangs in full view of the entrance and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
which bespeaks with no weak voice your fitness to practice,
your professional ability. The importance of this point
cannot be overestimated. The intelligent visitor expects
you to have had careful training and to possess thorough
knowledge of your work. If he notes the diploma as evidence
of it and of your pride in your college he is assured.</p>

<p>If only two rooms are at your command the second must
be at once consulting room, adjusting room, dressing room.
As such it should contain your desk, desk chair, chairs for
the patient or patients, adjusting table or tables, towel
cabinet, lavatory, and a curtained recess for a dressing-table,
chair, and hooks for hanging clothing. On the wall hang
those charts from which it is at times necessary to explain
a part of the human mechanism to the inquirer.</p>

<p>This room should convey a two-fold impression—business
and professional. It should contain the special paraphenalia
of your profession and some of the suggestive contents
of the ordinary business office, such as desk, card-index
file, typewriter, etc.</p>

<p>Let us consider these points more in detail.</p>

<h4>Waiting Room</h4>

<p>In your waiting room new patients wait and form their
estimate of you before your appearance. They are tired
patients, worn perhaps with years of disease, and their comfort
must be considered. Some time is theirs for use in
some way and the use of their minds during the waiting interval
must be studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>For these reasons first of all the waiting room should
be furnished quietly, in perfect taste, but <em>well furnished</em>.
A good dark rug for the floor rather than matting or linoleum
with their suggestion of bareness, a tinted or papered
wall done in a soothing shade, upholstered furniture pleasing
to the eye and comfortable for tired, weak bodies, and a
library table with proper literature for the occupation of
the mind—these are the proper furnishings for a waiting
room.</p>

<p>Let the table contain chiefly Chiropractic literature and
select that literature with care. Be sure that it reflects the
view-point toward your profession with which you wish
your patients to be impressed. It must be scientific, well
written, not sensational, not dealing coarsely or vulgarly
with the revolting diseases or features of disease, but quietly
convincing. Your literature must impress with the greatness
of Chiropractic without setting forth extravagant claims
which your patients will expect you to vindicate. Your
selection of books for the book-case must convince all observers
of your proper literary taste or the book-case had
better be omitted. Likewise the pictures on the walls must
suggest pleasant things, restful things, good to contemplate.</p>

<p>When possible secure a high-ceilinged room with good
ventilation, plenty of fresh air without drafts. And then let
all the articles in the room <em>harmonize</em>. One jarring note in
form or color may mar the entire effect, which should be
that of comfortable simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<h4>Private Office</h4>

<p>Even more important than the contents of the waiting
room is the equipment of your private office. It is in this
room that your work is done. There your patients confide
to you their weaknesses; there they determine finally whether
to trust themselves to your knowledge and skill; in that
room they form their judgment as to your cleanliness, your
use of system; <em>there they meet you</em>.</p>

<h4>Arrangement of Furniture</h4>

<p>Every bit of furniture for the private office having been
carefully selected its <em>arrangement</em> should be studied.</p>

<p>When the patient first enters the private office he should
be able to see your diploma. He should also sit where he
can notice it as he consults you and every other object within
his vision during the consultation should be picked so as to
avoid attracting his attention to anything foreign to his
visit and its purpose.</p>

<p>Two chairs are placed near the desk, one an easy
chair for yourself, a revolving chair being preferable, and
a straight-backed leather-upholstered chair for the patient.
In placing these chairs be careful of two things: let the
strongest light shine over your own shoulder and bring the
face of the patient out in clear detail; and let your own
chair be <em>higher</em> than the patient’s so that he looks slightly
upward to meet your direct gaze. For the last mentioned
point there is a sound psychological reason; to control any
dialogue with another person place yourself on a higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
level than he and unconsciously he will obey the suggestion
and lift his thought to meet yours, offering it rather than
commanding with it. The light is arranged for its value in
observing, as a matter of diagnosis, every indication in expression,
gesture, and skin coloring.</p>

<p>Hanging back of the desk where it may be easily reached
but where its gruesome suggestion will not obtrude itself
upon the nerves of the sensitive without your deliberate intention,
have a vertebral column for demonstration purposes.
There are many times when it is necessary to show a subluxation
as it would occur.</p>

<p>Beside the desk and within easy reach of your hand
should be placed at least a single book-case section containing
those reference works which you frequently consult.
The contents of this section will be considered later;
suffice now to say that they should be well bound and should
be so placed that if a doubtful point arise they can be consulted
at once without your rising. I am not of the opinion
that a pretension of unlimited knowledge is a valuable professional
asset. It seems better frankly to seek authoritative
information, even in the presence of the patient, than to
allow an error to creep into your work, and your more intelligent
patients will appreciate your care. Furthermore,
this placing of your books is convenient when you are alone
and considering the cases which have passed before you
during the day. It tempts to study.</p>

<p>The desk should hold a typewriter, significant of business
methods, and a card file for case records. Incidentally, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
should have neat bill-heads and printed stationery for all
correspondence, though blank white paper is better than
over-ornate design or profuse coloring.</p>

<p>On the wall hang a few good anatomical and physiological
charts upon which may be pointed out certain facts for
the instruction of patients. It may be suggested that these
hang on racks so that the surface charts may be easily
changeable and that those ordinarily exposed to view be such
as will avoid unpleasant suggestion of any kind. For instance,
an X-Ray chart of the body showing the skeleton is
but one degree less repugnant to the average person than
the bones themselves. Though your college training has
robbed the subject of all emotion, for <em>you</em>, take thought for
the feelings of your visitors.</p>

<h4>Adjusting Tables</h4>

<p>For all purposes the best type of bench now on the market
is probably that composed of two sections, one fixed
and the other—the rear one—sliding on a track. Both
sections should be adjustable at various angles to the plane
of the base and some of the best tables are made so as to
permit changes in the distance from the floor to the entire
top or to any part of the top, a great advantage in that the
table height may thus be made to suit the height of the
adjuster.</p>

<p>An abdominal support is now indispensable but must be
so elastic as not to interfere with the adjustment. Leather
upholstery is more sanitary than plush and has come into
general use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>An opening in the front section such that the face may
look downward through it and straighten the cervical and
upper dorsal spine for palpation and adjustment has been
proven a disadvantage instead of a help and will be entirely
unnecessary to one who follows the technic laid down in
this book.</p>

<h4>The Roll</h4>

<p>A desirable addition to this table is an upholstered roll
of quite solid material and about eight inches in diameter.
This can be placed under the patient’s thighs on the rear
section, thus elevating the thighs and straightening the
Lumbar region so as to separate the spinous processes. The
roll is especially useful for the adjustment of posterior Lumbar
subluxations, being inadvisable with rotation.</p>

<p>With a patient lying on the bifid bench in the ordinary
adjusting position the Lumbar spinous processes are crowded
together and the bodies separated. In rotation, since the
adjustment works by using a short power arm against a
long weight arm (distance from contact point to center of
rotation against distance from center of rotation to anterior
margin of body), and since the heaviest portion of the vertebra—the
body—is to be moved most, this position of suspension
secures the easiest adjustment. But if the vertebra
be posterior and a spinous process contact is used the best
adjustment can be secured over the roll or with a table adjustable
to an angle equal to that which would be secured
with the roll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<h4>Cleanliness</h4>

<p>Everything in the office should be kept scrupulously
clean. A lavatory with towel racks well filled with clean
towels is an absolute necessity. If no lavatory is inbuilt in
the office a portable one may be secured which will answer
every purpose. It will be well if the patient observes that
you carefully cleanse your hands before giving an adjustment.</p>

<p>The office should contain a towel cabinet with a stack
of clean towels and a compartment for used towels. Or
tissue towels may be used to save laundry bills. Before
each adjustment a clean towel should be unfolded and placed
upon the front section of the bench so that the patient rests
head and face upon a perfectly clean surface. When the
adjustment is completed toss the towel into the used-towel
compartment. This use of towels minimizes the risk of
contagion or infection from a germ-infested upholstery,
suggests care and cleanliness to your patient, and gives the
patient greater trust in you.</p>

<h4>Dressing-room</h4>

<p>A curtained recess separated by a screen from the remainder
of the room will serve if no separate room is available
for a dressing-room. It is better, if possible, to have a
separate dressing-room and better still to have separate
dressing-rooms for men and women. If extra rooms are
not at your command and you use a curtained recess be
sure that it contains good light, a dressing-table with mirror,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
a small chair, and hooks for clothing. Provide also a few
dressing-sacks for women though most of them will prefer
to furnish their own.</p>

<h4>The Rest Room</h4>

<p>It is a known fact that the patient who can be kept in a
quiet, restful, and relaxed state for some time following the
adjustment derives the greatest benefit therefrom. Having
loosened subluxated vertebrae by adjustment their tendency
is to settle in their old abnormal position and every movement
of the patient for a time aids this tendency. Quiet
permits adaptation of surrounding tissues to the changed
position of the vertebra; action facilitates the re-adaptation
of the vertebra to the state of surrounding tissues.</p>

<p>If possible a special room should be provided in which
patients may lie down in comfort for twenty or thirty minutes
following an adjustment. If more than one patient at
a time is to rest, separate rooms should be provided for
men and women. The rest rooms should have high ceilings
and excellent ventilation without drafts. The floors should
be carpeted so as to soften footfalls and suggest quiet and
rest. Potted plants adorn such a room very well and always
afford a pleasant suggestion.</p>

<p>The patients lie on cots, foldable for convenience when
not in use, and should lie on their backs as quietly as possible.
Some prefer solid cots on rollers so that the cot may be
noiselessly rolled beside the adjusting table after the adjustment,
the patient may by one turn move himself upon it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
it may then be gently rolled into the rest room. This is a
more finished, if more expensive, handling of the problem.</p>

<p>It may be well to furnish some occupation for the mind
and to this end, since reading in such a position is injurious
to the eyes, a good phonograph is a valuable addition. Equip
it with a soft parlor needle and select only soothing, restful
music. Just as you would avoid doing the walls of the rest
room in striking or garish colors, exciting to a diseased
mind, so avoid exciting or harsh music. The object of this
room is <em>rest</em> for mind and body. Let every thought be directed
to that end. With some patients the use of the
phonograph or other amusement must be avoided. Study
your cases with care.</p>

<p>The trip to the Chiropractor’s office is too often regarded
in the light of an unpleasant necessity. If proper care be
used in equipping an office and if such means as have been
suggested for the rest room be employed, these in addition
to the pleasing personality of the Chiropractor may make
of the visit a pleasant thing, a part of the day to be anticipated
with eagerness.</p>

<h4>A Complete Suite</h4>

<p>The number of rooms in a perfectly convenient suite
depends upon the approximate number of cases to be handled
daily. If it is needful to economize the practitioner’s
time a greater number of rooms will be required than would
be desirable with a small practice.</p>

<p>A waiting room, a consulting room, two or more adjusting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
rooms, and two rest rooms make probably the best
number and employment of rooms. It is desirable if possible
that the adjusting room be used for that purpose only
and that there be separate rooms for men and women. Each
adjusting room can then have its own dressing room or
recess. Or in addition to the other rooms named above
there may be many small rooms each containing an adjusting
table and a rest cot and each serving as the rest
room after the adjustment. If a sufficient number be provided
as many patients can be handled in this way as time
permits, the practitioner need lose no time at all, and each
patient may have a room entirely to himself throughout
his visit.</p>

<h4>Reference Library</h4>

<p>This should consist of those standard works to which
you will necessarily refer most often. Gray, Morris, or
other standard anatomical authority, Brubaker’s or Haliburton’s
physiology, Butler or Osier on diagnosis, Delafield
and Prudden on pathology, Morat on the physiology of the
nervous system, Bing on regional diagnosis of nerve lesions,
one or two good works on psychology, gynecology, histology,
etc., a good medical dictionary, and any books on Chiropractic
in which you have confidence make up an excellent
list. Any standard works will suffice and this list is merely
suggested for those who may be uncertain as to their own
tastes. Always examine a book before buying it, even those
named above. Next to works on Chiropractic no single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
book is as necessary or useful as a good medical dictionary,
preferably a large and complete one.</p>

<h4>Door Sign</h4>

<p>Your door should bear a sign in gold or black, setting
forth your name and business and perhaps your office hours.
It may read, “W. R. Jones, Chiropractor,” or, “Jones &amp;
Jones, Chiropractors,” with office hours appended. Avoid
repetitions such as “Dr. W. R. Jones, Chiropractor,” or
“W. R. Jones, D. C., Chiropractor.”</p>

<h4>Advertising</h4>

<p>The word of a satisfied patient to his friend is the best
advertisement. Beyond this, considerable diversity of opinion
exists as to what constitutes proper, ethical, and wise
advertising. I shall make no attempt to settle this question
but shall simply suggest that while it is undoubtedly necessary
often to explain to the public through various avenues
what Chiropractic is and what it can do it is wise to be as
reserved and dignified as possible and to avoid offense to
any. Thus it is clearly unwise to advertise that your competitor
is a fraud, much wiser to convince your readers by
the logic and strength of your statements that <em>you</em> are not.
Consider good taste and avoid unpleasant references to
loathsome or vulgar diseases. Such advertising is associated
in the public mind with quackery, with patent medicines
and medical institutes, and no matter how sincere and right
your motives may be it will be misinterpreted by those you
wish to reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>Consider also the legal side of advertising. Study the
laws of your state and avoid any statement which will conflict
with the law. In some states it is illegal to advertise
with the term “Dr.” unless you hold a medical license. In
others to advertise to “treat,” “cure,” or “heal” disease is
to practice medicine technically. Such statements miss the
truth, in any case, because the Chiropractor administers an
adjustment and not a treatment and because Nature alone
can cure or heal.</p>

<h4>Collection Cards</h4>

<p>Different communities respond to different collection
methods. With one class of patients it may be better never
to mention fees except to answer inquiry and simply to submit
monthly statements of account to all patients. With
another it is necessary to charge in advance. More Chiropractors
use this method than any other and many use cards
for the purpose.</p>

<p>These cards are best printed with name, address, telephone
number, etc., on one side and on the other six or
twelve spaces ruled off at one end for punching to indicate
adjustments given, and the words, “Good for six (or twelve)
Chiropractic adjustments at (office) (residence) when
properly countersigned.” A line should be left below for
your signature and at the bottom the price of the card
should be printed plainly. If desired a space may be left
for the patient’s name so that the card may be made non-transferable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p>The card is issued at the beginning of a course of adjustments
and a duplicate is kept on file. Each time the
patient is adjusted he presents his card before leaving and
one space is punched out. By this system both the patient
and the adjuster may know exactly the number of adjustments
given and accounts may be easily kept. Without it,
a book entry of some sort must be made for every adjustment.</p>

<p>The best thing about this system is that it reminds the
patient that you expect to be paid in advance without the
necessity of your saying so, since the words “in advance”
follow the statement of price on the card. At the time of
payment you give him, as a receipt, a card entitling him to a
certain amount of your service at a stipulated place.</p>

<h4 id="h_54">Schedule of Examination</h4>

<p>This method of procedure for the investigation of new
cases is offered as a suggestion to be followed as far as the
education of the Chiropractor will permit. If every practitioner
adopts some such method of making his own diagnoses
he will advance in ability much more rapidly than by
accepting the diagnoses given his patients by physicians or
others. We should remember, though without arrogance,
that our special ability to discover subluxations and our
knowledge of their significance as the primary causes of disease
renders us better prepared for correct diagnosis than
our medical friends, other education being equal.</p>

<p>It should be quite obvious that in attempting the accomplishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
of any object it is necessary first to have in
mind a clear preconception of the things to be accomplished,
and second, to have a clear and concise, yet complete, outline
of the steps to be taken, their order or sequence, and their
relative importance in the accomplishment. These two
needs, as regards a Chiropractic diagnosis, we shall endeavor
to supply in this section.</p>

<p>Chiropractic Diagnosis properly consists of three parts,
Vertebral Palpation, Nerve-Tracing, and Symptomatology,
together with the reasoning necessary to properly weigh and
summarize the facts ascertained. Of these three divisions
two fall properly under the head of Physical Diagnosis and
the third, symptomatology, should consist principally of
physical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Everywhere the physical or objective sign is given preference
over the subjective symptom. Before a single question
is asked of the patient relative to the case or its history,
every other means of obtaining information properly coming
under the head of a Chiropractic diagnosis should be utilized.
The questions should come last and be very few and direct.
They should serve only to illuminate the few remaining
doubtful points in the mind of the examiner, points which
perhaps exist only because of some fault or weakness in his
methods of examination.</p>

<p>The proper order of examination is as follows:</p>

<p>1. General Observation.</p>

<p>2. Vertebral Palpation.</p>

<p>3. Nerve Tracing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>4. Special Examination.</p>

<p>5. History of Case.</p>

<p>6. Summary.</p>

<h4>General Observation</h4>

<p>Observation of the patient with a view to determining
any signs of disease should begin with the moment the
patient steps into the office. It should continue during your
conversation and during the Vertebral Palpation and Nerve
Tracing which follow. The mind of the examiner should
be constantly on the alert to note any sign on any exposed
part of the patient’s body, or any motion which may betray
the nature of the disease or diseases with which he suffers.</p>

<p>Before preparing the patient for palpation observe temperament,
position and carriage of head, body, and limbs,
and facies.</p>

<p>Ask male patients to strip to the waist and female
patients to remove all clothing down to the waist except
a loose gown or kimono, which is worn reversed so that it
opens behind and exposes the spine to direct examination.
No greater error can be committed than to attempt examination
of the vertebral column through clothing or other
covering. Examine with patient seated on a bench or stool
with feet evenly placed upon the floor. If the patient is for
any reason unable to assume this position the examination
may be varied somewhat.</p>

<p>While in this position continue observation of points
mentioned above and observe also condition of skin, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
abnormal in color, moisture or nutrition, or whether there
is flushing, cyanosis, or pallor, roughness, eruption, etc.; the
condition of bones and joints other than vertebral; general
emaciation or obesity, local malnutrition or hypertrophy;
evidences of operation, scars etc.; and action of muscles
more in detail than is indicated under position and carriage
of parts.</p>

<p>Having observed these things discontinue general observation
and all other considerations for the time in favor of
Vertebral Palpation.</p>

<h4>Vertebral Palpation</h4>

<p>The primary object of Vertebral Palpation is the location
of subluxations, or partial displacements, and the determination
of the relative degree and direction of those
found. Next comes the recording of subluxations in such
a manner that a perusal of your record will enable you to
reconstruct at any time a mental picture of the spine, as
far as possible. (See <a href="#h_11">Record</a>.) With the making of the
record the proper form of adjustment for the correction of
each subluxation is decided.</p>

<p>Finally, by <em>failing</em> to find subluxation in certain segments
you may safely eliminate those segments from consideration
and confine your further attention to the remainder.
(See <a href="#h_48">Spino-Organic Connection</a>.) It must be borne in
mind that while the finding of a subluxation is not always
positive evidence of the necessity for adjustment there, the
<em>absence</em> of subluxation of any spinal segment is proof positive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
that no disease exists in the corresponding somatic
segment. Differential diagnosis is thus often greatly aided
by palpation.</p>

<h4>Nerve Tracing</h4>

<p>Having thus narrowed the field of operation, trace from
spine to periphery every nerve tender enough to be traced,
noting the relation of the tender nerves to the subluxations
already found by palpation. Whenever it is possible note
the <em>degree</em> of tenderness of the various nerves and keep in
mind through the remainder of the examination the fact that
greater tenderness in some one segment indicated either
greater or more acute disease in that segment.</p>

<p>It is best to use great caution about entirely eliminating
any segment from consideration because of negative findings
in attempted nerve tracing. The fact that no nerve is traceable
is not always proof that no impingement exists, but only
that no <em>irritation</em> exists. Only light or acute impingement
may irritate a nerve. In forty, and possibly fifty, per cent
of all cases no nerves are traceable at any time. (See <a href="#h_23">Nerve-Tracing</a>.)</p>

<h4>Special Examination</h4>

<p>The examiner has by this time formed some concept of
the case in hand. He has a clue to the possible nature of
the disease and he has narrowed his observation to a few
segments of the body or a few organs which demand a
more special examination. This may be accomplished by
Inspection, Palpation, Auscultation, and Percussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<h4>History of Case</h4>

<p>Having determined by these methods every fact possible
of determination without information from the patient, it
becomes necessary to go somewhat into the history of the
case. The history of falls, jars, shocks, or injuries of any
kind should be taken first and these should be viewed in the
light of their bearing upon the previously ascertained condition
of the spine. Sometimes the definite history of an
accident immediately preceding the development of disease
symptoms suggests its connection with the disease and the
exact nature of the accident points out to us some one of
the several recorded subluxations as the one involved. This
in turn may aid a doubtful differential diagnosis. Each
step in the process of examination helps to explain and
clarify the facts elicited by other steps until the facts marshal
themselves into a complete and comprehensible picture.</p>

<p>At this point it will be possible to stop in some cases and
rest upon the evidence gathered. If you are able at this
time to state clearly the nature of the case, the manner of its
cause, the site of disease and of the subluxations causing it,
the kind of subluxations, and the chance of recovery under
adjustment, it is preferable to do so. You will thus have
made a complete diagnosis without recourse to information
from the patient except the history of injuries.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, it will be necessary to go further
into the case and ascertain the presence and nature of subjective
symptoms. If this be necessary, the examiner should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
confine his questions to the parts indicated as diseased, and
thus limit the number of questions and make them all direct
and essential. It is important to avoid trivial or irrelevant
questioning.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Finally, having ascertained all necessary facts, mentally
summarize them all, combining the results of Palpation,
Nerve-Tracing, and Symptomatology so as to reach a definite
conclusion as to the location and nature of the morbid
process, the subluxation producing it, and the exact form of
adjustment necessary to correct it.</p>

<p>The examiner should be able at the end of the examination
to state exactly what he finds to be the condition of
the patient, to give reasons and nerve connections, and to
demonstrate a subluxation to back every statement.</p>

<p>The case record should contain all essential information
relating to the diagnosis and the correction to be applied.</p>

<h4 id="h_55">Necessity for Correct Diagnosis</h4>

<p>Diagnosis, in a restricted sense, means merely the naming
of diseases. But in the broader and more proper sense it
means disease knowing and includes a knowledge of the
causal factors, the location and nature of disease, the
amount of damage to structure and of functional disturbance,
and the probable duration and outcome of the case
either with or without Chiropractic adjustments. In this
broader sense we use the term hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>The object of diagnosis is correct adjustment. Including
as it does palpation, nerve-tracing, and symptomatology,
the Chiropractor’s diagnosis of a case should embrace all
the knowledge upon which he proceeds with his adjustment.</p>

<p>There are really two all-important questions which constantly
recur to confront the busy practitioner. One is,
“What is the matter with my patient?” and the other, “What
can I do to relieve him?” Practice resolves itself into these
two divisions, diagnosis and adjustment.</p>

<p>The real question which should suggest itself to the
thinking Chiropractor is not, then, “Should a Chiropractor
study diagnosis?” but rather, “From what viewpoint should
we study diagnosis? Upon what portions of the subject
shall we concentrate our attention?”</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the most important branch of diagnosis
to us is vertebral palpation. By its use we discover those
facts about the spinal column without which we are entirely
unable to proceed as Chiropractors. Knowledge concerning
the spine is the <em>most essential</em> part of diagnosis.</p>

<p>Next in order of importance comes the study of physical
or objective signs throughout the body—the examination
of the body for the discovery of all the changes in the
size, shape, position, etc., of organs which indicate disease.
This includes nerve-tracing, which in some cases
is the most important branch of physical diagnosis after
vertebral palpation.</p>

<p>Finally, a certain degree of examination for <em>subjective</em>
symptoms may be necessary. But the Chiropractor of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
future should become, and probably will become, par excellence
a <em>physical diagnostician</em>.</p>

<p>For many reasons we should be able to rely upon our
own diagnoses. Capability in diagnosis renders us independent
of the errors or false beliefs of others. Since it
includes a knowledge of subluxations, not included in medical
training but still vital to correct interpretation of morbid
phenomena, it can be more accurate than any diagnosis
which ignores these causal factors. A habit of diagnosing
one’s own cases enables one, always resting on his own
judgment, to correct and improve himself through all errors,
for which he is then alone responsible.</p>

<p>A general knowledge of medical diagnosis, of pathology,
bacteriology, etc., enables a Chiropractor to meet the physician
on common ground; in fact, it gives the Chiropractor
a distinct advantage, since he knows not only what his
medical friend knows but also the all-important facts regarding
the spine which are unknown to others. Such
knowledge and the ability to discuss disease intelligently
also furnishes common ground with every patient. Each
patient is a specialist in the disease he believes himself to
have and he expects from his doctor a greater knowledge
than his own.</p>

<p>The recognition of contagious or infectious diseases
as such is an absolute necessity in order to obey the laws
and safeguard the public health. The exact condition and
degree of vitality of the patient and the knowledge of the
existence of abscess, gangrene, intestinal obstruction, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
often warns the Chiropractor that his adjustment would be
dangerous to the patient. Much possible injury is avoided
by accurate diagnosis. Even the frequency with which
adjustments should be given depends upon diagnosis.</p>

<h4>Special Cases</h4>

<p>There are certain cases which a Chiropractor is powerless
to aid and immediate recognition of such cases will save
much trouble. In intestinal obstruction from intussusception
or from strangulated hernia, for instance, it is best to
advise the calling of a surgeon immediately, while in obstruction
from volvulus or intestinal paralysis the adjustments
may afford relief and should at least be tried first
of all.</p>

<p>Any internal abscess presents a possibility of rupture
into a serous cavity or the substance of a parenchymatous
organ and is therefore dangerous, while a superficial abscess,
pointing toward the surface, can best be cared for
by adjustment. A badly ulcerated or gangrenous appendix
may rupture under adjustment and be followed by diffuse
peritonitis. The fragile walls of the ileum in typhoid may
perforate under adjustment, while in its earlier stages the
disease is easily curable. The rotted vertebral bodies in
Potts’ Disease (spinal caries) may be crushed under the
heavy hand of an ignorant adjuster.</p>

<p>Intelligent case-taking <em>must</em> include accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<h4 id="h_56">Frequency of Adjustments</h4>

<p>The frequency of adjustments in practice should be
determined entirely by the nature of the case and the circumstances
in which patient and adjuster are placed. No
hard and fast rules can be laid down but some general
advice may be profitable.</p>

<p>Acute fever cases may be adjusted, until the fever is
broken, oftener than any other type of cases. The chief
object is the regulation of the temperature, after which
the body is able properly to repair itself. Sometimes it
may be necessary to give from two to six adjustments in
a day and in at least one tetanus case the adjustments were
given at intervals of about ten minutes for several hours
until the fever was under control. After such a series it
is wisest to refrain from adjusting again for several days
so that the patient may recuperate during the interval, providing
the fever does not return. It has been noticed that
after a series of adjustments given at short intervals the
improvement of the patient often extends over a period of
days or weeks.</p>

<p>In ordinary chronic cases, with good vitality and reactive
power, the daily adjustment is best at first. Then after
a course of from six to twenty-four adjustments according
to the judgment of the practitioner, the interval is lengthened
and adjustments given on alternate days, a day of rest
intervening between each two. In weak patients or those
who are extremely sensitive, the shock of the daily adjustment,
even at first, and the demand on the body’s recuperative
power may be greater than can be met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>In this connection it may be mentioned that the author
has encountered several cases of dorsal lordosis produced
by too heavy and too frequent adjustments, straining the
ligaments faster than they could be repaired and continuing
the strain over too long a period. It is possible to <em>over-adjust</em>
a patient, producing a weakened spine and other
deleterious effects, just as it is possible to establish a “tolerance”
for a drug by long continued use.</p>

<p>During a long course of adjustments it is well to allow
the patient an occasional week of complete rest, or even
more, and it may be wise after a time to reduce the number
of adjustments to two per week in some cases.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the practice of giving one adjustment
a week from the beginning, as followed by some
practitioners who maintain offices in numerous localities and
visit each one day per week, is not generally productive of
good results and it is the author’s practice to refuse new
cases who profess their inability to take more than one
adjustment weekly. The interval is so long that all repair
work started by each adjustment is completed and an involutionary
change sets in before the next.</p>

<h4 id="h_57">Specific vs. General Adjusting</h4>

<p>By specific adjusting is meant the selection and adjustment
of the vertebra or vertebrae which are known to be
causing definite disease or weakness. The term “specific
adjustment” implies that there is a particular reason existing
and recognized for every vertebra adjusted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>General adjustment, on the other hand means either the
adjustment of all palpable subluxations, or of all the most
noticeable ones, or of all found providing that no two successive
vertebrae be adjusted, according to the beliefs of
different elements in the profession.</p>

<p>Specific adjusting relies upon the diagnosis and requires
correct interpretation of disease. General adjusting considers
only the condition of the spine and is given upon the
principle that if the spine is right the man is right—a
perfectly correct principle regardless of whether or not the
general adjustment is advisable. Let us consider some of
the arguments for and against each method and reach a
conclusion if possible.</p>

<p>The use of specific adjustment demands of the Chiropractor
an accurate diagnosis and compels him to get his
mind into direct contact with the exact condition of the
patient in order to select the proper vertebrae. Sometimes
the less prominent subluxation causes a more acute or dangerous
disease than the more pronounced. Specific adjusting
tends to develop more discriminating and accurate
palpation.</p>

<p>Specific adjusting weakens and shocks the weak or
nervous patient less than general adjusting. It also concentrates
the recuperative or reparatory power of the patient
on the parts which <em>most need repair</em>. The body possesses
only a certain limited capacity for combating disease or
building weakened tissue. To scatter this force widely is
to weaken its effect in any particular locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>The habit of specific adjustment and of selecting proper
vertebrae enables the Chiropractor to explain definitely at
any time just what he is doing and why he is doing it. We
assert that in adjusting a vertebra we are removing the
primary cause of disease. It is sometimes awkward to be
asked if the patient has nine diseases or if it takes nine
subluxations to cause one case of acute coryza. A correct
answer to either question leaves an embarrassing discrepancy
between theory and practice.</p>

<p>In favor of the practice of general adjusting it has been
said that errors in diagnosis become unimportant if all subluxations
be adjusted; that if the spine be straightened the
patient <em>must</em> recover. Against the first statement, which is
forceful because diagnosticians are so notably liable to err,
it may be said that errors in palpation are almost, if not
quite, as frequent as errors in other branches of diagnosis
and that one’s tendency to err is less if all possible methods
be checked against each other than if one only is used.
The second statement is quite true; but it is based upon
the assumption that in ordinary practice the spine <em>may</em> be
straightened completely. As a matter of fact this rarely,
if ever, occurs. It is practically impossible ever to thoroughly
“line up” a spine. The best that has been done as
yet except in acute subluxations is to so modify subluxations
that disease disappears.</p>

<p>We may interject here the statement that no greater or
more conclusive betrayal of incompetency can be offered
by a Chiropractor than the declaration that he has completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
“lined up” a spinal column in one, six, or a dozen
adjustments, as some have declared. If one be honest in
such statements it is proof positive that he is not capable
of accuracy in palpation or else lamentably liable to auto-suggestion.
Clinicians of proven ability, who have examined
more than five thousand spines each, agree that no
perfectly normal spine has been discovered, whether the
spine has been adjusted or not.</p>

<p>But the chiefest argument against general adjusting is
that it scatters the reparatory forces of the body throughout
many segments, some of which are not really in need of
attention, while the one or two segments which need all
possible concentration of energy receive only a diluted
share.</p>

<p>If my patient suffers from an acute pneumonia and
nothing else and if I require that he submit to a general
adjustment including some eight subluxations, two of which
are Lumbars, I am unscientific and unwise. What that
case demands is an immediate localized improvement.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that the efficient Chiropractor of
the future will be a specific adjuster; that every recognized
body condition will suggest a definite and scientifically determined
corrective measure; and that guesswork will be
largely eliminated.</p>

<h4 id="h_58">Talking Points</h4>

<p>The things which it is most important that the Chiropractor
should set before his patient are the theories and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
facts peculiar to Chiropractic, perhaps adduced by Chiropractic
investigations alone. These theories and facts have
been discussed elsewhere in detail: the subluxation theory,
easily demonstratable with a spinal column as an object
lesson, the relations between primary and secondary causes
of disease, the directness and completeness of the results of
vertebral adjustments, these explanations are more convincing
than the display of a wealth of knowledge of methods
and theories used by other schools of practice. Chiropractic
has been builded not by virtue of previously established
truths but solely on the vitality of the new principles enunciated
by it.</p>

<p>These new ideas cannot hope for full and immediate
credence and must be presented carefully, with this fact in
mind and with due consideration for the degree of intelligence
of the listener. Avoid argumentative discussion with
patients, seeking rather to enlighten them about those facts
peculiar to Chiropractic and unknown to them than to
antagonize them by contradicting their cherished beliefs. It
is much wiser to begin with that knowledge of disease which
you hold in common with the patient and advance with
him, step by step, from that firm foundation to new truths
than to begin by attempting to tear down his beliefs. Reason
from the known to the unknown. Replace an old idea
as to the causation of disease by quietly inserting a new
one of greater verity and it will presently and painlessly
crowd out the old. This process is much the simplest and
easiest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless in presenting Chiropractic we must be
gently positive. Chiropractic is known and provable. Always
able to fall back upon the clinical test as a final argument
with supreme assurance that it will not fail to vindicate
our claims, we may present an unshaken front before
the most powerful and intelligent attack.</p>

<h4 id="h_59">Promises to Patients</h4>

<p>The majority of patients will require from the Chiropractor
an expression of his belief in his ability or inability
to cure them. They will desire a statement as to the probable
time required for a cure. They may even ask a guarantee
of success.</p>

<p>These questions are hard to meet truthfully and convincingly,
for the truth is that every Chiropractor fails sometimes
and is unable to predict that failure in advance and
that no one wise enough to predict the length of time which
will be required for the cure of any given case has yet arisen.
And these truths do not sound reassuring or convincing.</p>

<p>Explain to the patient that nature alone is the curative
agent and that the cure depends not alone upon the skill
of the adjuster but upon the exact condition of the vertebrae,
the exact amount or degree of damage to tissue, the
patient’s habits of living, etc. Any accidental interjection
of other factors into the case may have an important bearing.
You may assure him of the excellent results you have
obtained in other cases similar to his, or even cite individual
cases if to do so does not violate a professional confidence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
But you had best avoid a promise to cure or an
exact statement of the time which will be needed. State
your belief or opinion but do not bind yourself to a promise.
Offer your best skill and closest attention; you can do no
more.</p>

<p>The patient should rely upon the skill of the Chiropractor
as upon the skill of his lawyer or his physician.
Neither can honestly promise that he will succeed in his
efforts, even though all indications point that way.</p>

<h4 id="h_60">Re-Tracing of Disease</h4>

<p>From the original concussion of forces which produces
a nerve-impigning subluxation to the stage of chronic disease
with which the patient usually approaches the Chiropractor
for relief, disease develops by a series of gradual
steps. Successive changes take place from time to time in
the degree of subluxation as it is augmented by further
jars, strains, etc., or by the reaction of secondary causes
upon it and with these changes come corresponding changes
in the development of the disease.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first effect of the bad subluxation is irritation
of a nerve and acute functional disturbance such as
pain, fever, etc. The later effect may be paralysis and its
attendant train of evils.</p>

<p>When the Chiropractor begins adjustment he does not at
once return the long-displaced and misshapen vertebra to
its normal position. He merely <em>tends</em> to do so, his adjustments
making slight and gradual changes from the abnormal
back to normal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it is that the subluxation passes back in reverse
order through the successive stages of its development, following
a process which may be called the involution of the
subluxation. At the same time the morbid process resulting
from the subluxation tends to retrace its steps, passing
in reverse order through the stages by which it developed.
Pains which have not been felt for years may unaccountably
return under the reawakening of the long dormant
nerves. Headache, long absent but once a prominent feature
of the disease, may again make its appearance. The
patient <em>feels</em> worse.</p>

<p>These changes, however, take place much more rapidly
during the correction than during the development of the
disease. To a certain extent they are probably always present,
although in many cases they occur so rapidly or are
modified so much by changed environment as to be unrecognizable.
In many cases it is possible by securing an accurate
history and by careful observation of the patient’s
progress to observe a definite reappearance, in reverse
order, of every important event in the history of the disease.
For instance, if the patient has at one time had a
severe fever, perhaps lasting many weeks, and has later
developed a chronic weakness marking the increase in degree
of subluxation, the fever may reappear during adjustments,
last a day or two, and disappear forever, having
been corrected beyond that stage.</p>

<p>If explained in advance to patients with chronic diseases,
the facts of retracing may not cause the patient to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
become discouraged as he would if he failed to understand
them. If he knows before your work is commenced that he
may expect such phenomena but may possibly escape them
he meets them as necessary parts of the process of cure.
If they are not explained in advance he is likely to feel
that you are doing him injury and to discontinue your
service just at the time he most needs them. In fact, it
occasionally happens that if adjustments are stopped at
some irritant stage of the cure that condition will remain
and do great damage.</p>

<p>This theory of retracing has been much abused. Chiropractors
have used it to cover a multitude of errors in practice.
With some it becomes a habit to call all unfavorable
events which occur during adjustments retracing, thus
shifting the blame from their own shoulders to Nature’s.
This is a pernicious practice because it deceives the patient
and also because too frequent repetition of this explanation
finally deludes the practitioner into the belief that all such
events really <em>are</em> retracing. This view withdraws his attention
from his own technic and he ceases to discover his
own mistakes by ceasing to look for them.</p>

<p>It is best in the face of any painful or apparently unfavorable
development always to examine our own work thoroughly
to detect any possible error in diagnosis, palpation,
or selection of move for correction. It is always possible
for us to err and our cases should be observed at every
stage with the most minute care to insure accuracy in
detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<h4 id="h_61">Limitations of Chiropractic</h4>

<p>There are many things which can be done better by
others than by a Chiropractor. There are others for which
the Chiropractor’s training does not fit him at all and to
which his methods do not in any sense apply. Knowledge
of these limitations is just as essential as acquaintance with
the powers of the vertebral adjustment.</p>

<p>Bony dislocations other than vertebral, fractures,
wounds causing, or likely to cause, hemorrhage or severe
internal injury, should at sight be diverted into the hands
of a surgeon. The Chiropractor receives no training in
handling such cases and has neither legal nor moral right
to attend them. In obstetrics likewise no practical training
is given which would prepare the practitioner for delivery
and he is unprepared to use necessary asceptic or antiseptic
measures.</p>

<p>Some individual cases of disease usually curable will
have advanced so far as to require surgical interference.
Abscesses or suppurative diseases internally located or having
any liability to discharge internally must be avoided.
Gangrene, cancer, the advanced stages of tuberculosis
(usually) are incurable.</p>

<p>Quarantinable diseases as a class yield readily to adjustment
unless some serum treatment has been administered,
when the chances of recovery are greatly lessened. But
such cases must be reported in conformity with the laws
of the state and will probably then be taken out of the hands
of the Chiropractor—unfortunately. The laws of the various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
states should be modified to permit Chiropractors, with
precautions required of physicians to safeguard the public
health, to pass quarantine. Every effort should be put forth
to secure such legislation but until it is secured in any
state and the Chiropractor’s work is brought under the
supervision of the authorities, the laws must be respected
strictly.</p>

<p>Syphilis and gonorrhoea, communicable diseases, should
be recognized and refused in practice. The former in the
primary and secondary stages (not tertiary) and the latter
in all stages is corrective by adjustment but the liability
of transmission of the disease warns against contact with
it unless all precautions known to science be used to avoid
possible transmission.</p>

<p>Congenital anomalies of structure do not yield to Chiropractic
and are best let alone although no harm is likely to
arise through any attempt to correct them by vertebral
adjustment.</p>

<h4>Relation of Chiropractic to Other Methods</h4>

<p>There are certain other methods which present a superficial
resemblance to Chropractic which leads many to
believe them closely related. Such methods are Spondylotherapy,
Osteopathy, etc. There is a system called Napravit
or Naprapathy which may be dismissed with the statement
that it is Chiropractic, renamed.</p>

<p>Spondylotherapy, on the other hand, is a system of treating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
disease which takes no account of the vertebral subluxation
as its primary cause and seeks to cure disease by
stimulating or inhibiting nerve action through the use of
mechanical, thermic, or electrical means. Its resemblance
is due solely to the fact that most of the treatment is applied
to the spine. As well might we say that serum injection
for meningitis is Chiropractic because the serum is introduced
by lumbar puncture into the spinal canal.</p>

<p>Osteopathy, since the profession has become aware of
the superior results obtainable by vertebral adjustment, is
rapidly adopting many Chiropractic methods and counterfeiting
it as far as possible. Perusal of their literature of
various periods clearly shows that this is a new growth
and that they have never adopted in theory what they sometimes
use in practice. In fact both the above methods <em>treat
disease</em>, following the theory of medicine with the use of
different remedies only, while Chiropractic <em>adjusts the cause</em>
of disease and avoids treatment of any kind. Chiropractic
is not a branch of medicine, never can be a branch of medicine
because it is inherently and fundamentally antagonistic
to the very basic principles of medicine, and no statute can
change the fact of such antagonism. But unless we adhere
strictly to the fundamental principles of our own practice
and limit ourselves to the methods which grow from those
principles Chiropractic <em>may become</em> a part of medicine.
Which brings us to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<h4 id="h_62">The Use of Adjuncts</h4>

<p>There are many methods of treating disease which are
more or less beneficial to the patient just as there are some
which are always injurious. Shall we employ such of these
methods as are beneficial as adjuncts to the practice of Chiropractic?
Or shall we adhere to the principle that the
treatment of disease is erroneous and the adjustment of
its cause the only logical method of procedure? There is
much to be said on both sides of this question which has
so long agitated the profession.</p>

<p>In the class of beneficial adjuncts may be placed massage,
hydrotherapy, spondylotherapy, dietetics, osteopathy,
Christian Science, suggestive therapeutics, mechano-therapy,
and many others. Each of these has its field of usefulness;
each taken alone is productive of some good in some cases
at least. Each might possibly augment the results of Chiropractic,
or hasten them in some cases, if judiciously used.
By judiciously used we mean the avoidance of any method
which would in the least interfere with proper vertebral
adjustment or its results or which might carelessly cause
subluxation. Osteopathy and mechano-therapy frequently
cause subluxation because of the ignorance on the part of
their users; they need not do so.</p>

<p>Among the pernicious adjuncts, or those which are harmful
if combined with adjustments or harmful whenever and
however used, may be mentioned drug medicine, serum
therapy, and electricity. The first two may sometimes prove
the lesser evil if used alone. With Chiropractic they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
always unnecessary and always tend to lessen the good effect
of adjustments. The latter alone is beneficial but in combination
with Chiropractic proves a double stimulant to the
nerves and should be avoided. The effect of these methods
when used with Chiropractic can never be accurately predicted.
One can only be certain that some unfortunate
effect will follow.</p>

<p>As a secondary consideration the Chiropractor has
neither legal nor moral right to practice medicine unless
he has received a state license to do so.</p>

<p>Having admitted that the forms of “mixing” indicated
as beneficial to the patient may be sometimes justifiable on
the score of immediate good to the patient, let us consider
another side of the question.</p>

<p>Just as surely as we admit into our practice any method
which attacks the disease itself, or which treats any other
than the primary cause of the disease, or which seeks to
stimulate or inhibit the functions of the body without freeing
the natural channels through which the natural healing
power of the body should be manifested, just so surely are
we adopting the medical theory and making our profession
a branch of medicine. Medicine uses many remedies for
the cure of disease. Medicine is now broader than the mere
administration of drugs. And no matter how we vary the
remedy, or what treatment we select, we are denying the
truth of the Chiropractic theory and admitting the truth of
the medical principle when we use adjuncts in our practice.</p>

<p>Nor are these adjuncts necessary. It has been demonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
by repeated observations that the Chiropractors who
use only the vertebral adjustment secure just as high a
percentage of results as those who combine one or more
other methods with it. This is due to various reasons:
the greater perfection attained in Chiropractic by those who
apply themselves with concentration to the task of settling
every problem by that means; the fact that adjuncts often
detract from the effect of adjustment as much as they add
results of their own; the tendency of the patient to prefer
and to insist upon the easier and less painful methods rather
than the adjustment.</p>

<p>The lay patient and the ignorant public are inclined to
give credit for results obtained to the best known method
used upon them. Thus in spite of the fact that Chiropractic
alone obtains a far greater percentage of results than
any other combination of methods, the patient is prone to
believe that the change of diet or the massage effected a
cure and to overlook entirely the least pleasant part of his
“treatment,” the adjustment. He does not understand and
cannot understand with a mind divided for the consideration
of several methods, the connection of the spine with his disease.
Often he fails to understand if Chiropractic is used
alone but he is forced to conclude that the spine <em>has</em> such
connection because adjustment of the spine cured him.</p>

<p>The use of adjuncts has done more to hold back the
advance of the profession in the public mind than any other
single factor except ignorance within the profession. Furthermore,
the Chiropractor who knows that he can rely upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
various other methods if his adjustment fails does not feel
impelled to <em>study his Chiropractic</em> as he should. He weakens
in practice, relying more and more upon adjuncts.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly proven that the Chiropractor who
uses <em>only</em> Chiropractic becomes the better practitioner by
necessity. It has also proven that the man who is expert
in Chiropractic needs nothing else, providing only that he
refuses those cases to which Chiropractic cannot apply
at all.</p>

<p>The only <em>real</em> problem in Chiropractic is the problem of
<em>adjustment</em>. All failures may be attributed either to lack
of knowledge and proper application of Chiropractic or to
the fact that the patient has not vitality enough to recover
from the disease. Do not shift the responsibility for failure
upon the system, since with one or two exceptions every
known disease has been cured by <em>some</em> Chiropractor, thus
proving its possibility. Realize that the work can be done
and that its doing depends upon your own skill in diagnosis
and technic.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that at some future time Chiropractic
will be used in connection with other beneficial methods
which will enable us to get results <em>sooner</em>, though not more
surely. It is also inevitable that Chiropractic will fail to
receive its proper place among healing methods unless we
force the world to believe in it as we believe; to know it
as we know it. If we develop our system in its purity until
it obtains general recognition at its true valuation we shall
have accomplished an infinite good for humanity for all
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>We should endeavor to accomplish the greatest good
for the greatest number, laboring rather for the ultimate
recognition of the subluxation theory and its application
at its real value than for immediate slight good or personal
gain.</p>

<h4 id="h_63">Personality</h4>

<p>He who would succeed in Chiropractic must have, in
addition to a thorough education in his profession, a proper
personality. This is the medium through which his education
becomes effective, the channel through which he reaches
the public, gaining their confidence and approval that he
may utilize his knowledge to their good. Many skillful
and well-educated practitioners have failed because they
lacked the proper personal qualities for attracting patients.</p>

<h4>Elements of Personality</h4>

<p>The most essential elements of a proper personality are
Courage, Conviction, Confidence, Honesty, Sympathy, and
Aggressiveness.</p>

<p>Courage, not recklessness or carelessness but a fearless
willingness to assume responsibility—the heavy responsibility
of our profession—is indispensable. He who accepts the
easy case or the chronic and slowly progressive one and
refuses to face the appalling rush of a dangerous and acute
malady; he who shrinks through fear for his reputation
from a grave risk, has no right in Chiropractic. He has
mistaken his calling. While we acquire the knowledge of
Chiropractic we acquire also a great responsibility for its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
use; we must utilize it wherever and whenever it is best
for the patient, whenever our chances of effecting a cure
are the best chances, without regard to ourselves or any
personal risk.</p>

<p>By <em>conviction</em> is meant a firm and well-grounded <em>belief</em>
in the greatness and efficiency of Chiropractic. Sincerity in
one’s practice is a prime requisite for success. A belief
grounded in <em>knowledge</em> girds the Chiropractor with an
armor so strong that no adversity can pierce it. He who
practices Chiropractic without believing in it is in his own
mind a cheat and a fraud and cannot expect ultimate prosperity.</p>

<p>Confidence in one’s own ability and knowledge, in one’s
power and skill to contest with disease, begets confidence in
others. Not conceit, not exaggerated egotism, but a healthy
and sane assurance and faith in oneself, engender that steadiness
of mind and of hand which make for accuracy and
excellence.</p>

<p>Without honesty with oneself, one’s profession, and one’s
patients, one forfeits public confidence—and justly. If we
promise that which we cannot perform, if we deceive our
patients by misleading explanations of untoward events, we
deserve failure. It is not intended here to refer to the cheerful
and optimistic manner and habit of speech which often
aids in the sick room to keep the patient’s mind at rest.
This may sometimes deceive the patient as to the gravity
of his condition and such deceit may be justifiable; but it
should never be extended to the family or to those who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
a right to know the real condition and cannot be harmed by
such knowledge. Strict honesty, whenever harmless to
others, should be the fixed policy of all practitioners.</p>

<p>The weak, strained minds of the very ill require and
demand <em>sympathy</em>; not the sort which expresses itself in
fixed words or phrases of condolence with the unfortunate
and at once forgets their needs and sorrows, but the deeper,
unspoken feeling of desire to aid, which springs from the
heart and finds its best expression in active assistance. If
you do not care whether your patient is or is not benefited,
if you have no other feeling for him than a business
interest in holding a case, you lack the strongest impulse
to hard work and study, the desire to aid.</p>

<p>Chiropractic is new. Its principles are yet unknown to
the general public. Also this is an age of keen competition
and it is our duty to our profession and to the world
that instead of hiding our light under a bushel we proclaim
our mission to all who will hear. We must be intelligently
and wisely <em>aggressive</em>. We must bring ourselves into contact
with the public in every legitimate way, compelling it
by force of logic and personality to see the reasonableness
and greatness of our work.</p>

<p>Question yourself in regard to these things. Examine
your own characteristics to discover whether any of these
essential elements of personality are lacking. If one be
found wanting cultivate it assiduously. Having chosen
Chiropractic as a life vocation, <em>work at it</em> not alone for the
acquisition of ever-increasing knowledge but for the unfoldment
of a powerful and winning personality.</p>

<h2 id="h_64"><a id="CHIROPRACTIC_PROGNOSIS"></a>CHIROPRACTIC PROGNOSIS</h2>
</div>

<p id="h_65"><b>Prognosis</b> is the determining, in advance of the fact,
of the probable course, duration, or outcome of a disease.
A Chiropractic prognosis is a prediction as to the changes
which will take place in a case during and after Chiropractic
adjustments.</p>

<p><b>General Prognosis</b> is an opinion expressed of a disease
without reference to any particular case. It is based upon
the experience of the profession and the average result
obtained with the disease. It furnishes only a basis for
consideration of the <b>special prognosis</b> of an individual
case. This latter must be based upon the general prognosis
of the disease and upon study of every modifying
factor present in the case, as general vitality, living habits,
facility of adjustment, apparent response to early adjustments,
and especially an estimate of the amount and kind
of damage done to tissue and the probability of its repair.</p>

<p>Only general prognosis can be set down as a guide to
others. To state even this with certainty and safety
many precautions must be observed. All cases included
as a basis of conclusions must be handled under standard
test conditions (see <a href="#INDEX">index</a>) as far as may be; in accepting
the observations of others one must be sure that
they are sufficiently trained and sufficiently careful and
veracious to render their statements reliable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>In order to introduce the subject to the literature of
the profession and to invite comment and discussion
looking toward the ultimate development of a complete
Chiropractic prognosis we shall set down, without further
preliminary, the general prognosis of those commonly
described diseases concerning which we feel qualified to
speak. No statement is made without the gathering of
reliable evidence.</p>

<h3 id="h_66">GENERAL PROGNOSIS</h3>

<p><b>Abscesses.</b>—Those abscesses which would tend to discharge
externally may be adjusted for with success and
will rapidly develop, point, and discharge, with quick
recovery. Those which might break internally absolutely
forbid adjustment because of the almost certain
occurrence of peritonitis, pyaemia, or other grave
condition.</p>

<p><b>Acne.</b>—Good, but usually slow.</p>

<p><b>Addison’s Disease.</b>—Few cases reported, and these
slow cures.</p>

<p><b>Adenoids of Pharynx.</b>—Prognosis so good as to contraindicate
operation in every case. The lymphoid
growths gradually and slowly absorb under adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Adiposis Dolorosa.</b>—Only one case seen, the Derkum
case. This reduced in six months of adjustment from
360 to 280 lbs. in weight, and was improved in every particular.
No final report received.</p>

<p><b>Alcoholism.</b>—Adjustments greatly aid a cure if alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
be discontinued at once, or if the daily consumption is
gradually and steadily decreased. No permanent cure
can be secured without the aid of the patient. Acute
alcoholic intoxication may be lessened at once by the aid
of a single adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Amenorrhoea.</b>—Prognosis excellent. One to several
months required. Conservative amenorrhoea, as in tuberculosis
or other wasting disease, disappears only with
the occasion.</p>

<p><b>Anaemia.</b>—If primary, yields slowly but surely. Secondary
anaemia depends upon some disease process and
its prognosis is that of the disease which produces it.</p>

<p><b>Angina Pectoris.</b>—A case for careful diagnosis. False
angina recovers with general building of nervous system.
True angina, usually associated with arteriosclerosis, is
frequently fatal and death may occur during any adjustment.
If this does not happen most cases recover, though
slowly. Let me repeat, there is great danger in handling
true angina pectoris.</p>

<p><b>Anidrosis.</b>—Usually responds to adjustments for the
kidneys.</p>

<p><b>Ankylosis.</b>—Almost any ankylosis, except that in
which there is gross deformity of the bones, would yield
to repeated applications of force along right lines. Only
vertebral ankyloses are amenable to Chiropractic adjustment
and those are usually broken in time.</p>

<p><b>Anterior Poliomyelitis.</b>—Chiropractic experience with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
“infantile paralysis” has been very extensive and gratifying.
During the febrile stage the disease may be
aborted by one or several adjustments with only slight
and transient paralyses resulting. The chronic paralysis
which follows an unadjusted case is curable, but restoration
of the motor function and trophic tone of the paralyzed
members is delayed while the ventral horn cells are
regenerated, the axons rebuilt, and the atrophied muscles
redeveloped. Often no apparent results will be obtained
for one or several months, after which gradual improvement
progresses to a complete cure.</p>

<p><b>Aphonia.</b>—Prognosis excellent. No failures reported.</p>

<p><b>Apoplexy.</b>—The occasional case in which a premonitory
partial paralysis precedes real hemorrhage responds
remarkably to adjustment so that with care the hemorrhage
may be averted. After hemorrhage the absorption
of the clot is slow and tedious, but about 50 per cent
recover.</p>

<p><b>Appendicitis.</b>—In the early stages of the acute form,
and in nearly all chronic cases, recovery is almost certain
under adjustments. Signs of suppuration indicate immediate
operative interference and drainage, and failure
to read the signs may lead to rupture, peritonitis, and
death. Acute cases yield very quickly as a rule.</p>

<p><b>Arthritis Deformans.</b>—In well developed cases some
almost complete cures have been effected in periods
varying from two to four years. Prognosis good as to
relief, but poor as to complete recovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p><b>Ascites.</b>—Fair prognosis, depending upon the nature
of the portal obstruction. Cirrhotic ascites does not yield
well.</p>

<p><b>Asthma.</b>—Spasmodic bronchial asthma is almost always
curable except in the very aged, but the usual
posterior curvature in lower cervicals and upper dorsals
requires time and persistent heavy adjustments for its
correction. The asthmatic paroxysm may be relieved
instantaneously, but will recur at intervals for a long
period before the cure is fully established. The cardiac
form of asthma depends upon restoration of compensation
for a leaking valve, and yields by irregularly
progressive diminution.</p>

<p><b>Blindness.</b>—As a condition, without qualifying terms,
blindness offers a bad prognosis. Most cases fail to
develop sight under adjustments. Yet some individual
cures in optic atrophy, in detached retina, and in other
conditions, attest the possibility. Cataract blindness perhaps
yields best.</p>

<p><b>Bradycardia.</b>—If symptomatic, yields as does the disease.
If primary, a few adjustments are usually sufficient.
In one case the first adjustment increased to 90
a pulse which had been at 60 for fifteen years. In twenty-four
hours, without further adjustment, the rate had
settled at 69 and there remained.</p>

<p><b>Bright’s Disease.</b>—Prognosis good, but some cases
terminate abruptly with intercurrent disease, such as
pneumonia. There is danger until the albuminuria has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
ceased and the strength of the patient markedly improved.
Probably the diseased kidney area is simply
walled off from the healthy tissue, which then hypertrophies
and takes on the work of the entire organ, or
pair of organs. If too much damage has been done, the
case will terminate fatally in time, even though its
progress is checked by adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Bronchitis.</b>—Acute bronchitis is quickly checked as
a rule. Chronic bronchitis may prove intractable, or
may require many months for a cure. There are exceptional
quick cures of the most chronic cases.</p>

<p><b>Caked Breast—Mammary Inflammations</b>.—Rapid and
positive cure follows proper adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Cerebral Softening.</b>—Prognosis bad.</p>

<p><b>Cerebrospinal Meningitis.</b>—Serious always, but no
fatalities reported in adjusted cases. Failure to modify
fever and cervical retraction within two or three hours,
and with one to ten adjustments, is alarming.</p>

<p><b>Chickenpox.</b>—Like smallpox and the other exanthemata,
chickenpox should be modified at once by adjustment
and all cases should be light, eruption hastened,
and fever quickly broken. Sometimes the rash may be
strongly marked and the disease run its usual course in
all particulars except fever and prostration, being a
febrile with absence of all the consequences of fever.</p>

<p><b>Cholangitis.</b>—Recovers quickly under adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Cholecystitis.</b>—Prognosis excellent.</p>

<p><b>Chorea.</b>—Prognosis excellent in acute and subacute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
cases, less favorable in chronic. No figures are available,
but many chronic cases fail to respond at all.</p>

<p><b>Cirrhosis of Liver.</b>—Doubtful. No statistics have
been compiled, but it seems probable that most cases are
unmodified by adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Congestion of Liver.</b>—Prognosis good.</p>

<p><b>Conjunctivitis.</b>—Readily curable, unless part of a more
general infection.</p>

<p><b>Constipation.</b>—Prognosis usually good, but some cases
which have paralyzed the intestines with drugs, or in
which atony of the intestinal muscles exists from any
cause, are very stubborn. One is led to believe that any
case of chronic constipation would respond to proper
adjustments in time, but sometimes the time is prolonged
more than seems reasonable.</p>

<p><b>Coryza.</b>—Some cases respond instantly, others persist
and run their usual course. Chronic nasal catarrh recovers
in favorable climates, and in unfavorable tends to
become permanent, though less severe and annoying
under adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Croup.</b>—Always dangerous, but no fatalities reported
under adjustments, which are powerfully effective. Croup
requires constant attention until all symptoms subside,
usually within an hour or two.</p>

<p><b>Cystitis.</b>—Usually curable, but some chronic cases
prove intractable for an unknown reason. There is no
way of recognizing the curability of a case before the
attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>

<p><b>Deafness.</b>—Variable outlook. Deafness due to catarrhal
occlusion of the Eustachian tubes is usually curable.
That due to middle ear disease sometimes yields. That
due to nerve disease is possibly—though not certainly—incurable.</p>

<p><b>Diabetes Insipidus.</b>—Prognosis excellent. Few cases
fail of cure, and no fatalities are reported.</p>

<p><b>Diabetes Mellitus.</b>—Always necessitating grave and
careful consideration, this metabolic disease is marvellously
controlled by Chiropractic adjustment. Probably
90 per cent of all cases are curable, and only those presenting
impossible problems of adjustment, or those in
the very last stages, are hopeless.</p>

<p><b>Diarrhoea.</b>—Prognosis depends largely upon secondary
causes. Adjustments sometimes produce diarrhoea
to cleanse the intestinal tract of waste or poisons.
Such a diarrhoea, if instituted by Nature without aid,
does not cease with adjustments until its purpose is accomplished.
Nervous and infective diarrhoeas usually
respond well.</p>

<p><b>Dilatation of Heart.</b>—Compensatory hypertrophy and
strengthening of the muscle usually follows adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Diphtheria.</b>—Under adjustment the false membrane
tends to exfoliate and to be coughed out entire within a
few hours, with rapid recovery. In children, watch for
possible strangulation from loosened membrane. Constant
bedside attention is imperative until fever and membrane
have disappeared. Convalescence, unless antitoxin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
has been used, is very rapid, and physicians watching the
clinical course of diphtheria under adjustment customarily
doubt the diagnosis unless culture is made. Antitoxin
modifies the prognosis toward gravity, and in spite of
adjustments persistent sequelae often follow its use.</p>

<p><b>Dropsy.</b>—Cardiac or renal dropsy disappears with
improvement in the diseased organ.</p>

<p><b>Dysentery.</b>—In temperate climates death is extremely
unlikely. Recovery is often quick and easy, but some
cases persist. The tropical amoebic dysentery seems
hardest to master and may not improve at all.</p>

<p><b>Dyspepsia.</b>—Prognosis good.</p>

<p><b>Endocarditis.</b>—If primary, recovery is the rule. Occurring
in the course of some other disease, as rheumatic
fever, it renders the prognosis less certain and may terminate
fatally. Likely to leave chronic valve weakness or
contraction.</p>

<p><b>Enteritis.</b>—Prognosis generally fair. No figures
available.</p>

<p><b>Enuresis.</b>—The majority recover within a few weeks
or months, with occasional exceptions. Failure to get
results within a few weeks suggests a change of
adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Epilepsy.</b>—Doubtful. Less than half of all cases recover,
and no case can be pronounced cured until all
symptoms have been absent for a year. Cases with anterior
cervicals offer the poorest chance. It is usually
possible to restore consciousness and muscular control<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
by an adjustment during the grande mal, in the instant
between the tonic and clonic spasms, but such immediate
response does not—unfortunately—always mean that a
cure will eventually be effected.</p>

<p><b>Epistaxis.</b>—Nose-bleed usually stops at once following
proper adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Erysipelas.</b>—Cases adjusted early show little spreading
of the eruption with but slight constitutional symptoms.
After eruption is fully developed it is more difficult
to keep down the fever and recovery is slower, but
none the less certain unless cardiac or other grave
weakness is present.</p>

<p><b>Exophthalmic Goitre.</b>—Like other forms of goitre this
may be reduced, and with its reduction all other symptoms
disappear. Many cures are on record.</p>

<p><b>Friedrich’s Ataxia.</b>—In hereditary cerebellar ataxia
(which is probably congenital, rather) cures are limited
to 40 per cent or less. History of instrumental delivery,
with marked upper cervical subluxation, argue for the
natal origin of the disease and increase the probability
of cure.</p>

<p><b>Gallstones.</b>—Prognosis excellent. The calculi absorb
under adjustment by a reversal of the chemical process
by which their deposit was induced. When small they
may pass through the ducts and escape, with slight pain.
Adjustment during the painful passage of a gallstone may
act upon the duct so as to lessen greatly the pain and
hasten the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p><b>Gastralgia.</b>—Like other gastric neuroses, is easily
curable but may sometimes require correction of a
neurotic diathesis, which means time.</p>

<p><b>Gastric Ulcer.</b>—Usually recovers, but occasionally
leaves a fibrous cicatrix which cannot be affected by adjustment
and which, if located at the pylorus, may produce
stenosis, with consequent incurable dilatation of the
stomach. Operation is required for such a condition,
but the diagnosis is difficult, and it may be best to test
with adjustments for some time.</p>

<p><b>Gastritis.</b>—Prognosis good. To prevent recurrence
adjustments should continue after symptoms subside.</p>

<p><b>Goitre.</b>—Prognosis good. One large goitre under the
author’s observation was reduced in one week so that the
neck measurement decreased one inch. Most cases require
several months for complete reduction.</p>

<p><b>Gonorrhoeal Rheumatism.</b>—More stubborn than other
forms of rheumatism and sometimes defies adjustment.
No percentages are available. It is probable that nothing
but a general cleansing of the system will prevent
recurrence.</p>

<p><b>Hay Fever.</b>—Perhaps one-half of all adjusted cases
recover fully, some at once and some after several months.
By recovery is meant failure of the annual appearance of
the attack with no symptoms at any time. No case can
be pronounced cured in less than a year. The remaining
half are modified little or not at all.</p>

<p><b>Headache.</b>—Nervous, bilious, ocular, and reflex headaches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
yield well. Toxic headaches, or those accompanying
systemic infections, give way slowly with the cleansing
of the system.</p>

<p><b>Hemorrhoids.</b>—Excellent, except when lower lumbars
are anterior and defy adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Hernia.</b>—In all sites and forms of hernia, excepting
strangulated hernia, prognosis is good. Strangulation
requires immediate surgical interference. Prognosis is
better if a truss be used.</p>

<p><b>Hodgkins’ Disease.</b>—Prognosis theoretically good,
but the few cases under adjustment, while benefited, seem
to have died of intercurrent disease, so that it is well to
suspend judgment.</p>

<p><b>Hydrocele.</b>—Theoretically hydrocele should respond
well, but in practice the author has seen several failures,
and no cures.</p>

<p><b>Hydrocephalus.</b>—If due to cervical twisting at birth,
the prognosis is fair; otherwise bad.</p>

<p><b>Hypertrophy.</b>—Adaptative hypertrophies, those due
to overstrain upon an organ, do not and should not disappear
until the strain has been relieved. Hypertrophy
is sometimes accelerated by adjustment, as in the case of
defective heart valves, when thickening of the wall restores
and maintains compensation. Other hypertrophies
tend to disappear under adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Hysteria.</b>—Good, but slow. Some extreme cases refuse
to respond. Instant recovery from hysterical coma
is the rule following adjustment, but the coma tends to
recur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p><b>Immunity.</b>—There is no doubt that adjustments often
confer immunity from infection and contagion, but it is
so difficult to strengthen every part of the body against
every possible infection or contagion, and so uncertain
that immunity really exists in a given case, that it is best
always to assume the possibility of contagion and act
accordingly. Adjustments following exposure to known
contagion are always wise, but one may never know, if
they succeed, that the patient might not have escaped
without them.</p>

<p><b>Impotence.</b>—Variable outlook, according to secondary
causes and pathology. Previous venereal disease renders
the prognosis most doubtful. Nervous or vascular impotence
is likely to respond well. If due to cord disease,
the prognosis is to be made on the original disease.</p>

<p><b>Influenza.</b>—Mortality not more than 2 per cent, and
that in the very aged and infirm. Duration varies greatly.
May yield at once, first adjustment being followed by disappearance
of fever, profuse perspiration, and completed
convalescence in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours;
or may require several adjustments at frequent intervals
to break fever.</p>

<p><b>Insanity.</b>—No accurate tabulation of results in different
forms of insanity has been made. Numerous
successes, interspersed with fewer failures, have been reported.
The author has both succeeded and failed with
acute dementia, but the failure was a twenty-four-hour
trial only, and included but three adjustments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p><b>Intestinal Obstruction.</b>—The prognosis of intestinal
obstruction from intussusception or strangulated hernia
is, under Chiropractic, bad. Such cases are almost surely
fatal unless operated. Faecal obstructions or masses of
worms, also volvulus, respond quickly and prognosis is
good. Careful diagnosis is required before taking a case
of apparent complete obstruction.</p>

<p><b>Irritable Heart.</b>—If purely nervous, recovery is quick
and easy. If there is a drug diathesis or organic disease,
slow and doubtful.</p>

<p><b>Jaundice.</b>—Yields readily, but if of the obstructive
form the obstruction must first be reduced or removed by
adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Laryngitis.</b>—A few adjustments suffice for simple
acute cases. Specific laryngeal infections are more difficult.
Laryngitis with ulceration, which is either syphilitic
or tubercular, may not recover or may recover after
a protracted struggle. Chronic laryngitis of other forms
is curable, but requires more time than acute.</p>

<p><b>Leucorrhoea.</b>—Fair prognosis only.</p>

<p><b>Lumbago.</b>—Good, unless pain prevents proper adjustment.
True lumbago is quick to respond.</p>

<p><b>Malaria.</b>—Tenacity varies according to climatic conditions.
Malarial cachexia always yields slowly, sometimes
defies adjustment altogether. No reports are to be
had on pernicious malaria. Other forms recover though
paroxysms tend to recur several times before checked, but
of shorter duration than if no adjustment is given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mastoiditis.</b>—Good results in the few cases observed.</p>

<p><b>Measles.</b>—Excellent. Recovers quickly. Eruption
hastened by early adjustment, runs very mild course with
little or no fever, catarrhal symptoms disappear early.
No sequelae.</p>

<p><b>Meniere’s Disease.</b>—Labyrinthine disease of this character
has been cured, without reported failures, but data
is meagre, not more than three or four cases having come
under the author’s notice.</p>

<p><b>Menorrhagia—Metrorrhagia</b>.—Results excellent, and
usually quick. One fifty-two-hour intermenstrual hemorrhage
from uterus was stopped in one hour by adjustment,
with no recurrence.</p>

<p><b>Migraine.</b>—Migraine, or hemicrania, gives a fair prognosis
only. Most cases require a long course of adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Movable Kidney.</b>—Prognosis good, but change of position
and complete fixation slow. No treatment required—merely
adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Myelitis.</b>—Transverse myelitis, if adjusted in the acute
stage, may be checked as any other inflammation, and
the damage and resulting paralysis will be greatly
lessened or altogether prevented. The paralyses which
follow myelitis require time for the rebuilding of the
degenerated axons whose course is interrupted at the
diseased area, but tend to recover.</p>

<p><b>Myocarditis.</b>—Reports conflict. It is well to consider
this a grave condition and one open to investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p><b>Myxoedema.</b>—Only one case known to have been
under adjustment, and this after several years was
markedly improved, but not yet quite cured.</p>

<p><b>Nephritis.</b>—Prognosis good. Acute cases show rapid,
chronic cases slow, improvement.</p>

<p><b>Neuralgia.</b>—Prognosis excellent in any form. Trophic
neuralgias, such as herpes zoster, are slowest as a rule,
but occasional cases of tic doloureux will require several
months. One may always expect a cure unless the
patient, in long cases, becomes discouraged and stops
adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Neurasthenia.</b>—Good, but will be slow unless mental
aid be given in the form of freedom from worry or strain.</p>

<p><b>Neuritis.</b>—Good, but very uncertain as to time; some
cases show quick disappearance of all pain and some
drag interminably.</p>

<p><b>Optic Atrophy.</b>—Complete atrophy with total blindness
is rarely cured, though occasional partial or complete
cures have been reported. Partial atrophy may
slowly recover, or recovery may cease at some point short
of completion and case remain stationary thereafter.</p>

<p><b>Ovaritis.</b>—Good, except in suppurative forms. When
adhesions have been formed, results are doubtful.</p>

<p><b>Pancreatitis.</b>—Obscure, hard to recognize, and hard to
cure. Prognosis probably bad.</p>

<p><b>Paralysis Agitans.</b>—Probably in the earliest stages
this is curable. Cure of a fully developed case is exceedingly
doubtful and the writer has yet to see marked benefit
in such a case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p><b>Paralyses.</b>—Prognosis decidedly variable. Apoplectic
hemorrhage recovers in about 50 per cent of all cases.
Paralyses from central lesions require much more time
than peripheral palsies because of the necessity for rebuilding
degenerated nerve cells as well as fibres. The
paralyses following anterior poliomyelitis are almost certain
to be cured if sufficient time is allowed. Most
peripheral palsies, except in the very aged, are curable.
Any other paralysis but a purely functional one recovers
slowly, but this form may yield almost in a day.</p>

<p><b>Parotitis.</b>—Mumps respond immediately and may be
checked at any stage.</p>

<p><b>Pericarditis.</b>—Usually recovers. Effusions are stubborn
and may become purulent, in which case the
prognosis is grave.</p>

<p><b>Peritonitis.</b>—Prognosis grave, but some cases have
been reported as cured under adjustment. These are
probably localized rather than diffuse inflammations,
usually pelvic.</p>

<p><b>Pertussis, or Whooping-Cough.</b>—Tends to run its
course despite adjustments, though some aborted cases
are reported. All cases mild under adjustment, with
small liability of complications. A nervous cough is
likely to persist for months after the infection has passed.
Adjustments seem seldom to prevent contagion.</p>

<p><b>Pharyngitis.</b>—Acute form yields readily. Chronic
pharyngitis is more stubborn, but usually curable.</p>

<p><b>Pleurisy.</b>—Pleurisy, unless purulent or tubercular,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
yields well in varying periods. Purulent and tubercular
pleurisy are stubborn and may not recover.</p>

<p><b>Pneumonia.</b>—The author has had a wide and gratifying
experience with pneumonia. At every stage it
seems amenable to adjustment, and the usual effect of
the first adjustment is a drop of from one to two degrees
in the temperature with immediate softening of the consolidated
area. Specific adjustments get best and quickest
results. Pneumonia should <b>always</b> recover, unless it
occurs as an intercurrent event in some chronic and
wasting disease, as Bright’s Disease.</p>

<p><b>Potts’ Disease.</b>—Tubercular caries of the bodies of the
vertebrae is curable, within limits. Occasional cases are
seen in which Nature has stopped the spread of the disease
by walling off the morbid area with exostosis. Such
cases should not be adjusted, and the disease may remain
latent through a long life. When active the disease
proves fatal unless checked, which is possible in the
earlier stages, and becomes impossible when the vertebral
bodies are too fragile to stand strong adjustments. Discernment
in case-taking will avoid any fatalities under
adjustment, but by no means all cases of Potts’ Disease
are curable.</p>

<p><b>Pregnancy.</b>—We may correct by adjustment any
pathological conditions arising during pregnancy which
would be amenable to adjustment under other conditions.
A course of adjustments during a normal pregnancy will
render delivery easier and lessen, but not abolish, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
pains. Great care must be exercised in the manner of
adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Prostatic Enlargement.</b>—Varies according to age and
recuperative power. Prognosis is bad in the very aged
and infirm, but in more vigorous subjects quite good for
steady reduction of the hypertrophied gland, with subsidence
of attendant symptoms. Venereal history is
unfavorable.</p>

<p id="ptb"><b>Pulmonary Tuberculosis.</b>—In the early stages, where
little damage has been done to lung tissue, recovery is
rapid and quite certain. In fully developed cases, with
characteristic symptoms and marked damage to tissue,
prognosis is very grave, and it is usually wisest to advise
a trip to the Southwest in preference to adjustments.
Tubercular cases should be studied with a view to estimating
the exact condition and recuperative power of the
patient before taking.</p>

<p><b>Rachitis.</b>—Prognosis excellent. In a period varying
from six months in the best to five to seven years in the
slowest cases, all show complete or nearly complete cures.
All deformity may be checked in a short time and proper
bone nourishment established. Correction of deformities
existing prior to adjustment is a growth process. Too
many cases become discouraged at the slowness of the
work and stop adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Retinal Hemorrhage.</b>—Prognosis fair. Undoubted
cures have been recorded, as well as a few failures. At
least one case of hemorrhages followed by partially detached
retina has been cured, or nearly so, by adjustments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span></p>

<p><b>Rheumatic Fever.</b>—Hard to adjust because of its painful
nature. Results of proper adjustment usually, but not
always, good.</p>

<p><b>Rheumatism.</b>—Muscular rheumatism yields more
rapidly than articular. Acute tends to quick recovery,
chronic to more or less lengthened and slow improvement.
Rheumatic diathesis may require many months of careful
adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Rubella.</b>—Simply and easily checked. Rash slight,
and no prostration at all.</p>

<p><b>Scarlet Fever.</b>—Data on quarantinable cases is meagre,
but scarlet fever, or scarlatina, seems to be quickly
modified by adjustment. One may expect a drop of from
one to two degrees in temperature after first adjustment,
followed by steady rise, which will again be checked
by the next adjustment. Rash appears early, and all
symptoms are mild, but several days are often required
to put the patient at ease. Occasional sequelae, such as
endocarditis, otitis media, or other inflammations, occur
unless case be watched with great care. No fatal terminations
under adjustment except in cases which were at
first misdiagnosed.</p>

<p><b>Seminal Emissions.</b>—Prognosis excellent in cases uncomplicated
by masturbation or excessive venery; in such
cases bad until habits are changed.</p>

<p><b>Simple Continued Fever.</b>—Always recovers. Usually
drops one to two degrees shortly following correct adjustment,
with amelioration of all symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p><b>Smallpox.</b>—Infections vary in virulence. In temperate
climates all phases are hastened by adjustment and
tend to recover without sequelae. The milder smallpox
due to infection by vaccination is also amenable to adjustment,
and prompt handling will often prevent serious
poisoning.</p>

<p><b>Splanchnoptosis.</b>—Partial or marked relief is usual—and
slow. Complete natural replacement of all viscera is
the exception rather than the rule.</p>

<p><b>Splenic Enlargement.</b>—Variable prognosis according
to cause. Secondary enlargements due to systematic
infection yield with the disappearance of the infection.
Primary enlargements yield more readily as a rule, with
exceptions. Malarial spleen is slow to reduce.</p>

<p><b>Splenitis.</b>—Prognosis presumably good, but few authentic
cases reported.</p>

<p><b>Spondylitis Deformans.</b>—Prognosis favorable for slow,
slight improvement, but not for complete cure.</p>

<p><b>Strabismus.</b>—Excellent in young subjects, less than
fair in patients over thirty.</p>

<p><b>Sunstroke.</b>—Theoretically curable, but no experience.</p>

<p><b>Syphilis.</b>—The primary sore frequently dries under
adjustment without the development of any secondary
or tertiary stage. If first adjusted during the secondary
manifestations symptoms may readily disappear and no
tertiary stage ever appear. There are some authenticated
cures eight and ten years past without recurrence of any
sign. In the tertiary stage the organic lesions do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
respond. Prognosis is so hopeless in this stage that it
seems useless to apply Chiropractic at all.</p>

<p><b>Tabes Dorsalis.</b>—Posterior spinal sclerosis, commonly
called from its chief symptom “locomotor ataxia,” recovers
in 40 to 50 per cent of cases adjusted. No accurate
pre-judgment can be formed as to the probabilities
in any particular case without experiment, nor has any
adequate explanation been offered as to why some cases
recover and others do not. Those cases which improve
at all are likely to recover fully. In any instance, time
is required for the regeneration of the dorsal column
axons, and while this is going on no improvement may
be apparent at all.</p>

<p><b>Tachycardia.</b>—If symptomatic, as of exophthalmic
goitre, tachycardia yields as the disease does. If primary,
a few adjustments usually establish a proper pulse rate.</p>

<p><b>Tetanus.</b>—Only one undoubted case has been brought
to the writer’s attention and this one a marvellous cure.
Adjustments were given as often as every ten minutes
for a time.</p>

<p><b>Thoracic Aneurism.</b>—Cure exceedingly doubtful, and
fatal termination possible at any time. Little information
is at hand.</p>

<p><b>Tonsilitis—Quinsy</b>.—Simple or follicular tonsilitis
aborts under adjustment in from a few hours to two or
three days. Quinsy, or suppurative tonsilitis, runs its
regular course as to duration, but is frequently a febrile
after the first day. Spontaneous rupture of the tonsil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
will usually occur and sometimes two or three such ruptures
will lengthen the case slightly. Sequalae are wanting,
but all forms of tonsilar inflammation tend to recur
unless a long course of corrective adjustments is applied
to the cervical region.</p>

<p><b>Torticollis.</b>—Acute spastic or rheumatic torticollis in
which permanent contractures have not yet set in may
be cured almost invariably in a period varying from a
few days to several weeks. Chronic cases with permanent
contractures yield very slowly, but prognosis is good
for a fairly accurate straightening of the neck. Such
cases often leave slight abnormalities even in the most
competent hands.</p>

<p><b>Tuberculosis, Pulmonary.</b>—See <a href="#ptb">Pulmonary Tuberculosis</a>.</p>

<p><b>Tumors, Benign.</b>—Unlike malignant growths, benign
tumors, fatty, fibroid, etc., tend to gradual absorption
under adjustment. Perhaps 75 per cent or more may be
completely cured. Age is a factor, tumors in young subjects
being more readily curable than in the aged or
infirm.</p>

<p><b>Tumors, Malignant.</b>—Prognosis bad. If cancer in
any form can be cured proof has escaped the author’s
diligent search. It is wisest to refuse all cancerous cases.</p>

<p><b>Typhoid Fever.</b>—Prognosis excellent if adjustments
are commenced during first week of fever, in which case
the fever should be aborted at once, followed by one or
two mild exacerbations, then permanently checked.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Doubtful prognosis after first week, because of liability
to perforation during adjustment. After second week of
fever very grave prognosis under adjustment, and better
with nursing alone.</p>

<p><b>Uteroversion—Prolapsus</b>.—Uteroversions and prolapses
are corrected, sometimes rapidly but more often
slowly and gradually. Favoring circumstances are freedom
from overwork or overlifting. Some extreme cases
result in failure.</p>

<p><b>Valvular Diseases.</b>—These may be grouped for prognosis.
No percentages have been compiled, but it may
be said that the prognosis is generally good as to relief
and restoration of compensation, but poor as to rebuilding
of the valves. Many cases of apparent permanent
and complete recovery are probably simply cases of excellent
compensation. Death occasionally occurs despite
adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Varicocele.</b>—Outlook good for a slow, certain recovery.</p>

<p><b>Varicose Veins.</b>—Probability favors cure in subjects
not beyond middle life, providing they are not greatly
overweight or too much on their feet. Cure always slow.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
